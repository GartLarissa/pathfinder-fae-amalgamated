<h1 id="pathfinder-fate-accelerated">Pathfinder Fate Accelerated</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hey there! This document and the linked content provides a complete conversion (aka, a &quot;hack&quot;) translating concepts from the Pathfinder RPG by paizo games into the terms of Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE) by EvilHat games to allow Pathfinder material to be leveraged in a Fate Accelerated pick up game or campaign.</p>
<p>The main advantage to &quot;borrowing&quot; Pathfinder material for use in a Fate Accelerated game is that it allows a GM to easily take advantage of the many high quality professional resources published by Paizo such as maps, pawns, and artwork, but using a much lighter weight story based game engine with dynamic resolutions. Additionally, players that like Pathfinder that might not otherwise be interested in trying Fate Accelerated can be enticed to give Pathfinder FAE a shot and thus become introduced to the game.</p>
<p>We've had a lot of fun running a variety of games in this way, both using published adventures as well as homebrewed scenarios based in Golarion. We hope that others might find similar fun for themselves reusing the material.</p>

<p>Though nominally rooted on Pathfinder, this material works for D&amp;D flavored Fate Accelerated in general.</p>

<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<div class="tip">
<p>You can just pick or modify a premade <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics.aspx">Iconic</a> character if you prefer to skip character creation.</p>
</div>
<p>This section will guide you through the process of creating a Pathfinder Fate Accelerated character.</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with Fate Accelerated, you should find this to be a straightforward process as Pathfinder Fate Accelerated characters are basically the same as normal Fate Accelerated characters, with the added idea of &quot;Archetypes&quot; which are explained in detail, and a Race Aspect. Also, a magic system and guidance on gear and magic items are provided.</p>
<p>If you are not already familiar with Fate Accelerated, don't worry. You'll be walked through the process step by step; just grab a sheet of paper and a pencil and follow along.</p>
<h2 id="character-concept">Character Concept</h2>
<p>You should start off with some idea of what kind of character you want to make, in broad strokes. Often this comes down to an broad archetypical statement such as &quot;I want to play some kind of wizard&quot;, or perhaps a reaction against a stereotype such as &quot;I want to play a warrior...but a clever tricksy one&quot;.</p>
<p>The big idea, so to speak. This will likely get refined down and polished into your High Concept or Aspects later, but for now it is enough just to have a sense of what you are aiming for.</p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>You need a name, and though obviously you can fill this in when it comes to you, it's handy to have a handle for the character as you go thru the creation process. You can always choose a different name later if you change your mind.</p>
<h2 id="starting-refresh">Starting Refresh</h2>
<p>By default, characters are assumed to start with <strong>3 Refresh</strong>. However, the GM may alter this up or down if they want to start play with more or less experienced characters.</p>
<p>Refresh determines your character's default Fate point threshold; the number of Fate points you are guaranteed to start every session with. However, it also serves as the primary &quot;currency&quot; or resource that you use to gain other abilities for your character, primarily Stunts.</p>
<p>If you want to be flexible and interact with Aspects and thus the narrative more, you want to keep your Refresh high. If you prefer a less reactive style of play and prefer reliability and predictability you can trade Refresh for extra Stunts.</p>
<p>Having a high Refresh affords you a comfortable amount of Fate points to lean on each session, which gives you a measure of plot protection and lowers the impact of bad dice rolls. But even with a low Refresh you can accrue Fate points during play by accepting compels on your Trouble or Aspects.</p>
<h2 id="high-concept-and-trouble">High Concept and Trouble</h2>
<p>You need to define a High Concept, which is intended to convey the essence of your character. High Concepts are usually pithy, and ideally an interesting attention getter...the equivalent of an elevator pitch or a newspaper headline.</p>
<p>You also need a Trouble, which is the counterpoint to your High Concept. While the High Concept describes your character's essence, your Trouble describes the main source of dramatic tension in your character's ongoing story, the thing that holds them back, or causes them to get involved in circumstances that they'd rather avoid but which provide interesting interludes to their existence.</p>
<p>A good Trouble will not only make your character more &quot;real&quot;, it also will provide your most reliable means of regaining Fate points during play. Though it seems counterintuitive, a Trouble that doesn't really complicate your character's existence will make your character weaker, not stronger. You want to be compelled and involved in the narrative, and your character's Trouble is a primary enabler of that goal.</p>
<h3 id="not-yet-sure">Not Yet Sure</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may not have a fully crystallized concept when you start the character creation process, and thus balk at this step. Don't worry, you can change your selections later if your concept gets refined as you go through the process. However, if you are drawing a blank, just skip this and come back to it later when you are more confident that you understand what the character is going to be about.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-a-good-image">The Power Of A Good Image</h3>
<p>It can be helpful to have a good mental or visual image of how a character looks; you may be able to draw inspiration for the character's concept from their appearance. You may want to take a few minutes to sketch your character, or find something usable that is in the public domain online.</p>
<h2 id="race">Race</h2>
<div class="tip">
<p>Race is an extra Aspect; it does not take up one of a character's standard three Aspects.</p>
</div>
<p>Pathfinder characters must also choose a Race Aspect, which acts as a sort of supplementary High Concept. However unlike a High Concept, Race usually cannot be changed (without some serious magic, at any rate). All the standard Pathfinder Races (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, various halfsies, different Human cultures, etc) are available.</p>
<p>A character's Race is a fact about the character that is always true, and can be interacted with by other abilities that reference the Race.</p>
<p>Like all Aspects, Race has no direct mechanical effect unless invoked; it primarily provides a justification for a character to do something that a member of that Race is supposed to be able to do, per the source material. Actions are resolved using Approaches and Archetypes, and characters have the option to pay a Fate point to invoke their Race Aspect in the same way as they use any other Aspect.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance the player of an Elf could justify spending a Fate point to invoke their Elf Aspect to get a +2 bonus or a reroll on a notice check due to the stereotypically keen senses of elvenkind, while a Dwarf could justify spending a Fate point to invoke their Dwarf Aspect to get a +2 bonus or a reroll when defending against a magical attack due to the legendary spell resistence of dwarvenkind.</p>
</div>
<p>If there is some special ability that a character wants that pertains to their Race, at their perogative the GM might hand wave it away and allow the character to use their Race Aspect to justify actions and rely on <strong>Create Advantage</strong> in particular to handle this sort of thing, or they might allow an occasional use of a special ability with the expenditure of a Fate point, or they may require a character to take a Stunt defining the ability. This is left to GM preference, but by default Pathfinder Fate assumes that the more permissive method is generally preferred.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance many Races have the ability to see in the dark, but it may not always be relevant to the larger story, and making all members of such Races take a Darkvision Stunt can be unnecessarily taxing. Thus a GM might allow a character of such a Race to simply see in the dark due to their Race Aspect, or similarly may just require them to use the Create Advantage action to put a situational Aspect on themselves. Alternately the GM might require the expenditure of a Fate point to &quot;turn on&quot; Darkvision for a scene.</p>
</div>
<p>But if they are a stickler, a GM might require characters of a Race that can see in the dark to take a Darkvision Stunt (and so on for other such abilities). However, such GM's may want to consider bumping up the number of &quot;free&quot; Stunts or base Refresh to compensate for this sort of Stunt &quot;tax&quot;, otherwise members of Races that have a lot of common abilities expressed as Stunts will be very similar to each other and will have a lessened ability to define other abilities unrelated to Race.</p>
<h2 id="aspects">Aspects</h2>
<p>Aspects are at the heart of Fate, and play an important role in helping you to define your character.</p>
<p>In Pathfinder Fate Accelerated it is assumed that characters start with <strong>3 Aspects</strong>.</p>
<p>Your Aspects can be whatever makes sense for your character, but it can be particularly useful if they help to fill in the character's background and provide a foundation for how they came to have their abilities and how they became adventurers.</p>
<p>If you are at a loss for coming up with Aspects, try the following. Have your first Aspect hinge on your character's formative years, or their Race. Then, focus the second Aspect on the character's early adulthood and early successes or perhaps failures and perhaps how they picked up their Archetypes. Finally have the third Aspect ground what the character has been doing most recently prior to play starting, and perhaps anchor their career as an adventurer.</p>
<h2 id="approaches-and-archetypes">Approaches and Archetypes</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated uses the standard Approaches defined by Fate Accelerated; they represent how a character goes about doing something. Pushing the idea that how characters do things is often as interesting (or more so) than what they are actually doing is at the heart of what makes Fate Accelerated such a fun and rewarding game to play.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, two different adventurers with similar ability sets attempt to do the same basic thing. The two characters are basically interchangeable in this context, and the outcome of the resolution is relatively uninteresting based upon simple skill resolution semantics. But using Approaches, one of the characters might prefer to approach the problem Forcefully while the other does so Carefully, allowing very different narratives to emerge.</p>
</div>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated extends Fate Accelerated with the concept of Archetypes intended to capture a character's competencies in broad areas of capabilities modeled on various tropes of fantasy roleplaying in general and the D&amp;D or Pathfinder gaming experience specifically. The separation between divine, arcane, and nature-oriented magics, the unlikely stealth con artistry and burgling ability of various rogues, the feats of combative arms displayed by warriors of different stripes, adeptness at more esoteric abilities such as displayed by monks and psions and similar fringe concepts.</p>
<h3 id="approaches">Approaches</h3>
<h4 id="careful">Careful</h4>
<p>You act with caution, paying attention to the details. When you are holding back, taking your time, making extra special sure you get it right, leaving no opening for counterattack, maintaining situational awareness, buying time, or being guarded in your responses...you are being careful .</p>
<h4 id="clever">Clever</h4>
<p>You think quickly, and act with great finesse. When you do 'the smart thing', make intuitive leaps, exploit a nuance or a weakness, outwit or trick, execute choreographed or complex maneuvers, use an opponent's strengths against them, or otherwise rely on your smarts to solve something...you are being clever.</p>
<h4 id="flashy">Flashy</h4>
<p>You act in big showy ways, giving the appearance of sparkling brilliance and ostentatiously draw attention to yourself. Being larger than life is a speciality. When you go big, brazenly proclaim, entertain, seek to impress, bluster your way out of something, show off, or just do things while piling on with extra awesome style...you are being flashy.</p>
<h4 id="forceful">Forceful</h4>
<p>You act boldly with no hesitation and without holding back. Both physically and mentally you fully commit to what you are doing and exert yourself to your fullest. When you swing for the fences, throw your shoulder into it, grin and bear it, give it your all, and go all in...you are being forceful.</p>
<h4 id="quick">Quick</h4>
<p>You act swiftly and with great agility, fast and sure-footed. When you act without stopping to think, dart and weave, lunge and leap, use quick reflexes to respond in a hurry, squeeze in an extra little non-action, dash through before its too late...you are being quick.</p>
<h4 id="sneaky">Sneaky</h4>
<p>You act deceptively, secretively, attempting to avoid notice, in furtive and surreptitious ways. When you try to conceal or hide what you are doing, obscure your intentions, evade detection, appear to be other than what you are, set a trap or lay in ambush...you are being sneaky.</p>
<h3 id="archetypes">Archetypes</h3>
<p>Archetypes represent common broad character concepts found in the source material. The six (6) Archetypes are <strong>Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Divine</strong>, and <strong>Primal</strong>; detailed descriptions of each are provided. Individual characters can specialize in a single Archetype or mix Archetypes as they like to define various character concepts.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, a Cavalier might be defined as Combative +4, while a &quot;Fighter/Mage/Thief&quot; might be defined as Combative +1, Arcane +2, Roguish +1, and a Ranger might be defined as Combative +2, Primal +2.</p>
</div>
<p>Unlike Approaches which cap at Superb (+5), Archetypes do not cap. However, as characters only get another +1 to a Archetype at major milestones, progression is generally slow and each opportunity to advance a Archetype should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Each Archetype has three thresholds that represent increasing depth of a character's immersion in a particular area of ability, and also increasing the breadth of what the character can apply the Archetype to within the context of the story. Thus the difference between a +1 and a +2 in a given Archetype is more than just a probability bonus; the higher level of ability also provides expanded narrative justification for actions pertaining to that Archetype.</p>
<p>For each Archetype, +1 represents <strong>basic knowledge</strong>, fundamental skill, and general familiarity with the things the Archetype concerns itself with. In addition to providing a bonus to relevant 4dF resolutions, in conjunction with the character's Aspects and High Concept the first +1 of a Archetype also helps justify various things within the narrative. It is left to the GM's discretion, but in some cases a character that has Arcane +1 can justify attempting to do things in a particular way that a character without Arcane +1 simply cannot justify, and so on. In other cases a GM might allow characters lacking at least a +1 in a particular Archetype to attempt something, but at a cost or versus a higher difficulty...or both.</p>
<p>For each Archetype, +2 represents <strong>professional competence</strong>. This threshold is sufficient for all normal purposes for the majority of the people in the world.</p>
<p>For each Archetype, +3 represents <strong>exceptional competence</strong>. For the magic oriented Archetypes, +3 is when full unfettered &quot;free casting&quot; is achieved. For the non-magic oriented Archetypes +3 is when truly extraordinary feats beyond what is possible for &quot;normal&quot; people to accomplish become possible. Only remarkable people (some but not necessarily all player characters and significant NPC's) attain or exceed this threshold for even a single Archetype.</p>
<p>For each Archetype, +4 and higher represents increasingly <strong>sublime mastery</strong>. Having a bigger bonus helps to reduce the chance of failure and makes game-bending exploits statistically probable, but in practical terms such advanced levels of competence primarily matter when facing off against other similarly progressed characters.</p>
<h4 id="combative">Combative</h4>
<p>You have some skill in the warrior arts pertaining to direct armed conflicts, the waging of war, the winning of battles, and combat in general. Knowledge of weapons, armor, tactics, as well as the physical training and discipline necessary to be successful in such endeavors is relevant as well. This Archetype is strongly associated with conflict, battle, and martial concerns.</p>
<p>At +1 you know how to use and care for weapons more serious than clubs and daggers without embarassing yourself, how to wear armor heavier than leathers, and basic knowledge of martial culture. You don't have much finesse or technique, but are capable of basic strikes and blocks.</p>
<p>At +2 you have genuine skill at arms and are able to put together combos and flourishes. Depending on your inclinations and background you might be schooled in at least basic tactics and strategy, and possibly logistics as well; but even if untutored you can usually spot an ambush, recognize a defensible position, and so forth.</p>
<p>At +3 and above you are a world-class warrior, capable of impressive displays of martial mastery. You are capable of taking on large numbers of unskilled and less competent foes with reasonable odds of beating them all. Further, Combative provides narrative justification to defend against not only the mundane attacks it previously protected against, but also unusual and magical attacks that cause physical harm. This can take many narrative forms, from blocking, deflecting, using armor or shield effectively, or even just being extra tough due to being a hardened warrior.</p>
<h4 id="roguish">Roguish</h4>
<p>You are a competent, skilled individual of varied talents. This Archetype is strongly associated with urban 'civilized' concerns, social rules and expectations, and how to bend or break them.</p>
<p>At +1 you are good at cagey social interaction, have some innate shrewdness or are streetwise, and are good at being opportunistic. You are comfortable in urban areas and know how to handle yourself competently in such settings. You have some practical insider knowledge of the sector of society you are most familiar with and how things really work therein.</p>
<p>At +2 you are good at skulking around in urban areas, stealing things, getting in and out of places you shouldn't be in, dirty tricks 'dishonorable' fighting using pragmatic weapons true warriors tend to disapprove of, being shifty and evasive, and likely some knowledge of the less than lawful sector of society.</p>
<p>At +3 and above you are incredibly competent, deeply knowledgeable in your area of expertise, and are capable of succeeding at tasks beyond the reach of the less skilled. Additionally, Roguish provides narrative justification to defend against any kind of indirect or surprise attack and to avoid harm by getting out of the way of it. Narratively this can take many forms, such as rolling out of the way, ducking behind cover, 'seeing it coming' and somehow interupting the attack, and so forth.</p>
<h4 id="focused">Focused</h4>
<p>You are innately good at concentrating your inner power and physical potential into potent expressions of your will. This Archetype is strongly associated with athletics, contests of merit, creative expression, and innate ability.</p>
<p>At +1 you are more nimble, athletic, alert, and have a stronger force of personality than average. You are unusually aware of your own physical and mental limits and how far you can push against them to excel. You are better than average at fisticuffs, staying aware of your surroundings, and dodging.</p>
<p>At +2 you excel at feats of strength and of will, making uncanny leaps of intuition, impressive grappling and unarmed fighting, raw athletic exploits, perseverance in the face of adversity, tapping inner reserves, and so forth.</p>
<p>At +3 and above you are capable of impossible leaps, gate-crashing strength, inescapable grappling holds, astounding memory tricks, cowing entire crowds with sheer presence, and similar feats. Additionally, Focused provides narrative justification for extraordinary feats unattainable by merely normal people, though the nature of these abilities will vary according to the character's concept. Some achieve such heights of mental and / or physical mastery that they develop amazing monkish, psionic, or even innate &quot;spell-like&quot; abilities (if such things are appropriate to the campaign). It is also more likely for a character with this level of ability to avoid, shake off, or otherwise resist effects beyond the tolerence of a normal person to overcome; for instance withstand a poison that would kill a normal man, spot something too fast or subtle for most to perceive, resist or break out of mind control or domination, survive a fall from a great height, and so on.</p>
<h4 id="arcane">Arcane</h4>
<p>You are skilled in the mystic arts, whether wizardly, sorcerous, bardic, or some other style. This Archetype is strongly associated with esoteric knowledge, otherworldly things, and manipulation of &quot;magical principles&quot;.</p>
<p>At +1 you have relevant esoteric knowledge and awareness of magic, and you can use some magic items such as wands and scrolls that other characters can't use.</p>
<p>At +2 you can work simple spells such as levitating small objects, making magical light, shooting minor arcane blasts, and gain various momentary benefits from minor magical effects.</p>
<p>At +3 and above you can cast proper spells with more powerful effects, as appropriate to your character's concept.</p>
<h4 id="divine">Divine</h4>
<p>You are attuned to deific entities, theology, and things of cosmological significance. This Archetype is strongly associated with spiritual concerns, temples, the afterlife, and faith.</p>
<p>At +1 you have some basic theological knoweldge and a connection to a deity, or a pantheon of deities, or possibly a philosophy or ideal such as &quot;Law&quot;. You might have other associated abilities (such as Stunts) granted to you by a patron deity or as a byproduct of your observance of the tenets of your belief system.</p>
<p>At +2 you can attempt to ask for or channel minor divine intersession and aid, such as a blessing of favor, or healing a minor wound.</p>
<p>At +3 and above you can invoke much more powerful effects, equivalent in power to that possible with Arcane and Primal at higher levels...perhaps even 'miracles'.</p>
<h4 id="primal">Primal</h4>
<p>You are skilled in the ways of the wildlands. This Archetype is strongly associated with rural and unsettled areas, the circle of life, animistic beliefs, and the fundamental (dare it be said, &quot;primal&quot;) forces and principles of material existence.</p>
<p>At +1 you are comfortable in and have knowledge of the lore of the flora and fauna native to your chosen terrain or environment. You can hunt and survive and move stealthily in the wildlands.</p>
<p>At +2 you are attuned to the natural order, and have some craft that blurs the line between mundane and mystical, such as calming animals, passing without trace through undergrowth, divining water, and so forth.</p>
<p>At +3 and above you can work very powerful magics related to flora and fauna, the natural order, the weather, and the elements including the Inner &quot;Elemental Planes&quot; and other planes of existence with a strong connection to nature if such exist in the cosmology of the campaign.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-starting-bonuses">Assigning Starting Bonuses</h3>
<p>Character creation is slightly modified from standard Fate Accelerated rules.</p>
<p>Characters start with <strong>one Fair (+2), two Average (+1), and three Mediocre (+0)</strong> Approaches.</p>
<p>However, you also get <strong>four +1's</strong> to distribute any way you like among the six Archetypes of <strong>Combative, Roguish, Primal, Focused, Arcane, and Divine</strong>. You can assign your four +1's however you like; you could take +1 on four different Archetypes or +4 on the same Archetype or any other combination adding up to +4.</p>
<h4 id="limiting-starting-archetypes">Limiting Starting Archetypes</h4>
<p>Some GM's may prefer to limit starting characters Archetypes at Good (+3) or even Fair (+2). That's fine, but note that this will prevent many character concepts from being fully realized as starting characters.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to realize that in terms of competency, starting Pathfinder Fate Accelerated characters are roughly equivalent to 5th or 6th level Pathfinder characters. GM's that would prefer to start their campaign off at a higher or lower competency level should consult the <a href="#starting-power-level-options">starting power level options</a> guidelines for more information on how to go about doing that.</p>
<h4 id="taking-actions-with-approaches-and-archetypes">Taking Actions With Approaches And Archetypes</h4>
<p>When taking actions, you get to add one (1) Approach and up to one (1) Archetype if one applies to the situation; thus a character with Forceful +2 and Combative +2 would gain +4 when being Forcefully Combative.</p>
<p>Archetypes can be applied to all four actions (Create Advantage, Overcome, Attack, Defend).</p>
<h5 id="defending-with-archetypes">Defending With Archetypes</h5>
<p>Archetypes can always defend against themselves directly without need of extra narrative support.</p>
<p>For instance you can always defend against an opponent's Arcane with your Arcane.</p>
<p>Defending against a Archetype with a different Archetype is possible, but it requires some narrative support (i.e. you have to creatively explain how you are using the Archetype in the situation), and if it doesn't seem plausible it doesn't work, or works at a penalty. However, some Archetypes explicitly provide narrative support for defending against various things when a character passes a threshold of ability.</p>
<p>For instance Roguish +3 and higher explicitly allows a character to justify defending against any kind of indirect or surprise attack and to avoid harm by getting out of the way of it.</p>
<h3 id="milestones-and-advancement">Milestones and Advancement</h3>
<p>Approaches cannot be raised above Superb (+5), as is normal for Fate Accelerated. Archetypes on the other hand are not capped and can be raised as high as a character is able to progress.</p>
<p>At <strong>minor milestones</strong>, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't change anything; just use the rules as written in the Fate Accelerated rulebook.</p>
<p>At <strong>significant milestones</strong>, again nothing is changed. You may raise an Approach by +1, as normal. You may not raise a Archetype by +1.</p>
<p>At <strong>major milestones</strong> in addition to the various things you are already allowed to do, in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated you may also raise <em>either</em> an Approach <em>or</em> a Archetype by +1, your choice.</p>
<p>Unlike Approaches you generally cannot switch your Archetypes around after play starts. A GM might allow you to take a +1 off of a Archetype and put it on a different Archetype during a milestone if you can make a strong enough case for it, but this should be an uncommon occurrence...perhaps in conjunction with a change of High Concept.</p>
<h2 id="stunts">Stunts</h2>
<p>A number of additional Stunt templates and options are provided in the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section.</p>
<p>Stunts allow you to differentiate your character. They represent the &quot;signature&quot; abilities or items or <em>whatever</em> that makes your character really stand out.</p>
<p>Aspects cost Fate points to invoke for mechanical benefits, Stunts usually don't (though some very powerful Stunts might). Thus in addition to offering you a way to individualize your character, Stunts also allow you to &quot;pin down&quot; the things that your character is <em>reliably good at</em>.</p>
<p>Is your character supposed to be a &quot;swashbuckling sword-master&quot;? You would almost certainly have an Aspect to anchor that (it might even be your High Concept), but to really ensure that your character is <em>always</em> awesome at it when it mechanically matters (i.e. a dice roll is involved) without having to spend a Fate point for a bonus, you should define one or more related Stunts.</p>
<p>You get up to <strong>3 Stunts for free</strong>. You can also take more Stunts by lowering your Refresh by one (1) for each additional Stunt.</p>
<p>However, <strong>player characters cannot drop below Refresh: 1</strong>. Thus, when starting, you can take up to two (2) additional Stunts. You gain +1 Refresh at major milestones, and can use this to take more Stunts if you like.</p>
<p>You don't have to pick your free Stunts if you don't want to or aren't sure. You can start play and pick later, even during the course of the game if the GM allows it.</p>
<p>You can also swap a Stunt at milestones, so if you take a Stunt that seems like it would be cool but it doesn't play out so well, you can change your mind later.</p>
<h2 id="stress">Stress</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated uses the default Fate Accelerated settings of <strong>3 Stress boxes</strong>, shared for all kinds of stresses.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated uses the default Fate Accelerated settings for <strong>shared Mild, Moderate, and Severe Consequences</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>By default, it is assumed that the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a> are being used.</p>
<h2 id="money-and-equipment">Money and Equipment</h2>
<p>Though simulating some of the tropes of D&amp;D style gaming, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated isn't a loot-based game. PC's don't generally wander around &quot;killing things and taking their stuff&quot;. The focus is on allowing players to cooperatively tell a dynamic story full of excitement with a focus on the &quot;fiction&quot;...which is to say cinematic or prose-worthy narratives.</p>
<p>Unlike a more loot oriented game where over the course of adventuring characters accumulate power-ups in item form and eventually become walking magical weapon platforms defined more by their swag than anything else, in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated trappings are only useful to the extent that they help describe and enrich a character concept and further the story.</p>
<p>Thus, these guidelines take a very loose, abstracted stance on character trappings and wealth rather than bog things down with crunch.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't concern itself about the economy in the game setting a GM is using, or defining &quot;starting funds&quot;, or even tracking money by default.</p>
<p>From a character definition perspective, wealth or a significant lack of it should be reflected in a character's High Concept and / or Aspects, and that is sufficient.</p>
<p>Unless the GM objects, gear can just be written out narratively as trappings without worrying about associated monetary considerations.</p>
<p>If you are a player, ask your GM how they plan to handle money in their campaign. Then seed your character with trappings appropriate to their concept, taking your GM's guidance on what they'll allow into account.</p>
<p>If you are a GM, the <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Guidelines/MoneyOptions.aspx">Money Options</a> section goes into detail on various options and recommendations on how to handle economic considerations in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated handles mundane equipment narratively, as just a written out list of stuff.</p>
<p>For instance, the salty second mate turned treasure hunter <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Lirrial/Lirrial.aspx">Lirrial</a> starts with the following trappings:</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>She had a pile of money just two days ago, won at the tables...sadly she bet and lost most of it an hour later, and has drunk the remainder since. She currently has 3 sp, 16 cp and (inexplicably) two dried lima beans, a button to somebody else's coat, and some lint in her pocket.</p>
<p>She also has a seabag containing a couple of spare pairs of fine sailing outfits, a journal with a spotty and unreliable account of her deeds, and a broken music box that only has three and a half working teeth and thus plays a rather jagged tune. Even on land she wears a jaunty tri-corner hat suitable to a second-mate-for-hire, and always, always carries a deceptively deadly rapier with a fancy basket hilt, and keeps a stiletto well tucked away.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a rather flowery write up, but it tells us a lot about the character and suggests even more. The shifty Sczarni swordsman <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Eleo/Eleo.aspx">Eleo</a> on the other hand has these trappings, which is much more direct but also in its way tells us some things about Eleo's nature:</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>Eleo currently has a mere 4 gp, 12 sp, and 45 cp to his name. Considering the illicit wealth he came from this would depress most people. But for Eleo it is just another kind of freedom from his past.</p>
<p>Eleo carries two expertly crafted swords, two back-up daggers, and wears fine medium hybrid armor and stalker boots.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="relevance-of-specific-weapons-and-armor">Relevance of Specific Weapons and Armor</h4>
<p>While different weapons and armor certainly inform the narrative and help provide justifications as to what makes sense for a given character to be able to do in a scene or exchange, mechanically &quot;weapons&quot; and &quot;armor&quot; have no real significance as attack and defend actions are resolved using Approaches and Archetypes rather than gear.</p>
<p>The character's competency is the primary factor; the tool they are using to exercise that competency is secondary and only matters to the extent that it makes the story more interesting.</p>
<p>For instance, the detail that a particular character wields a spear might provide different justifcations for create advantage and overcome actions than if the character carried an axe instead. But when the character uses Combatives to <em>attack</em>  another character, unless there is some other consideration involved it doesn't matter mechanically whether they are using an axe or a sword or a spear or a whatever. The attack is resolved with a 4dF roll adding an Approach and Combatives to the result.</p>
<p>To the extent that a particular kind of weapon or armor (etc) matters to a character or to the emerging story, it should be incorporated into Aspects and Stunts.</p>
<p>For instance, the fact that <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Bordos/Bordos.aspx">Bordos</a> wears heavy armor and wields a hammer is reflected in his Aspects and Stunts. It is important to the character's concept and thus in the scenes that he is in he makes it matter to the narrative. On the other hand if Joe Fighterdude usually wears some heavy armor and uses a warhammer but didn't incorporate any of that into his concept in the form of Aspects or Stunts then ultimately it doesn't actually matter as anything more than fluff.</p>
<h4 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h4>
<div class="tip">
<p>A variety of [sample magic items] are available for reference and reuse.</p>
</div>
<p>Of course, in a Fantasy setting Magic is always the special case. By their very nature magic items can't be hand waved away as easily.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated makes a distinction between permanent magic items (or items with so many &quot;charges&quot; that they are very long lasting) and expendable magic items with one or a few uses.</p>
<h5 id="expendable-items">Expendable Items</h5>
<p>In general, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated handles expendable items like Scrolls and Potions using a modified Mook template that are either explicitly single use or have a small stress track to track usages. They don't require a Stunt or anything mechanical, they are just a thing a character carries until they use it up or give the item away or it is taken from them. They are merely a commodity.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="scroll-of-dimension-door">Scroll Of Dimension Door</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Magical Spell Trapped On Paper</li>
<li>Faintly Magical (Universal)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>+4 to cast Dimension Door.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[1]
Each usage box indicates a seperate use or application and each use expends a usage box; when there are none left the item is expended.</li>
</ul>
<p>This item requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="dimension-door">Dimension Door</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arcane Spell (Universal)</li>
<li>Teleportation</li>
</ul>
<p>Overcome while Cleverly Arcane to immediately teleport myself a short distance by overcoming a difficulty equal to the number of zones away the target is, +1. Thus to dimension door up to three (3) zones away would require me to overcome a Great (+4) difficulty, while five (5) zones would require me to overcome a Fantastic (+6) difficulty. When using this ability, I can not move a zone in the normal way, and if I fail the spell I go nowhere at all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="potion-of-cure-moderate-wounds">Potion Of Cure Moderate Wounds</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potion In A Flask</li>
<li>Faintly Magical (Healing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong> - A character may drink the potion as an action to 'cast' the spell Heal on themselves. Treat this as if the overcome attempt succeeded with four (4) shifts of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[1]
Each usage box indicates a seperate use or application and each use expends a usage box; when there are none left the item is expended.</li>
</ul>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="heal">Heal</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Divine Spell (Healing)</li>
</ul>
<p>While Carefully Divine, attempt to clear a specific stress box or Consequence by overcoming a difficulty equal to the numerical value of the stress box or Consequence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 id="permanent-items">Permanent Items</h5>
<p>Permanent items are generally represented as a Stunt, but more complicated or potent items are represented by a Stunt that takes one or more Stunt slots and attaches a secondary character (aka &quot;Mook&quot;) write up to the character, as described in the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section. Items that are a strong part of a character's core concept should also be anchored by an Aspect.</p>
<p>For instance <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Orlo/Orlo.aspx">Orlo</a> starts play with a magical sword, but the sword is an heirloom passed down to Orlo via a long lineage and is a core element of Orlo's origin thus far; this importance is represented by both a Stunt and an Aspect.</p>
<p>Unlike more loot based games, the GM doesn't &quot;reward&quot; players by handing out treasure and items, as anything other than story elements, or to decorate a scene or character while it narratively makes sense. And unless a PC internalizes a &quot;found item&quot; into their concept by incorporating it into a personal Aspect or Stunt, the item is just not that important to the emerging story and will drop out of the narrative when it makes sense for it to do so.</p>
<p>Similarly, if there is something presented in the story such as a &quot;magic item&quot; carried by a defeated enemy for instance, a PC might temporarily carry it around as represented by a situational Aspect, but permanently acquiring the &quot;magic item&quot; would likely be at the expense of an Aspect and / or Stunt. If the new shiny is not important to the character's concept then it really just doesn't have any relevance to the character's ongoing story and is merely a passing detail.</p>
<h2 id="modified-fate-ladder">Modified Fate Ladder</h2>
<p>The modified Fate Ladder adds a few more named rungs above Legendary (+8). You can, of course, still go higher as need be, but the extra named rungs should be sufficient for low, mid, and most high-powered play.</p>

</table>
<p>Pathfinder is a High Fantasy setting with big rats, oozes, and rabid goblins at the low end and demon lords, deities, and otherworldly powers at the high end.</p>
<p>In standard Fate Accelerated, Approaches cap at Superb (+5), and that is true in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated as well. But <strong>Archetypes do not cap</strong>, and are added to resolutions as applicable.</p>
<p>Thus, experienced Pathfinder Fate Accelerated characters can generate very large bonuses, allowing them to accomplish unearthly feats and overcome nigh-impossible challenges.</p>
<p>A Pathfinder Fate Accelerated character with around six major milestones under their belt should be roughly equivalent to a &quot;20th level character&quot; in the source material. Such experienced characters can potentially generate bonuses of +15 or even higher in their main areas of expertise.</p>
<p>This is expected, and intended. For most play groups and campaigns it will all work out. Very few campaigns would progress beyond a few major milestones in the first place, rendering power scaling at higher echelons of ability a moot point.</p>
<p>For campaigns that do make it to the higher end of play, or which start at a higher power level to begin with, the 4dF dice roll has a nearly insignificant effect on resolutions unless the characters are facing similarly powerful opposition.</p>
<p>Fortunately, being a narrative game, Fate Accelerated tolerates this just fine. Simply handle inconsequential resolutons narratively and save the dice rolling for situations where the variance of +/- 4 from a 4dF roll might have a meaningful effect on the outcome.</p>
<p>In context, this means that most resolutions between very powerful endgame characters and lesser opponents should just be narratively asserted in most cases. Not only is this perfectly reasonable (Archmages and world-class warriors are at most inconvenienced by stock opposition), it helps keep the game focused on interesting challenges by not wasting time diceing out resolutions with a basically foregone conclusion. A quick narration between the player(s) and GM about what happened, roughly how long it took, and what it cost the hero (if anything) is generally sufficient.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>Example: the <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Amarzedrin/Epic/Amarzedrin.aspx">Aspiring Archwizard, Amarzedrin</a> can generate up to a +14 bonus on his prepared spells, allowing him to cast truly epic magic. When faced with a mob of unruly but otherwise unexceptional ork mooks with a bonus of +2 on their best Good At, it is entirely reasonable for Amarzedrin's player and the GM to just agree that it takes mere moments for Amarzedrin to burn the lot of them to cinders at the cost of a prepared Fireburst spell and not bother with dice or direct conflict.</p>
<p>Afterall, the goal of the story probably isn't to explore all the many ways Amarzedrin can make the lives of minions such as these miserable and abruptly shorter; presumably there is a challenge more worthy of his epicness lurking deeper in the story.</p>

<p>The mystical Archetypes of <strong>Arcane, Divine, and Primal of +2</strong> allow a character to cast minor &quot;spells&quot; or &quot;blessings&quot;, using these guidelines.</p>
<p>In terms of the source material, this is the realm of &quot;0 level&quot; cantrips and orisons, and the occasional &quot;1st level&quot; spell or prayer.</p>
<p>The mystical Archetypes of <strong>Arcane, Divine, and Primal of +1</strong> allow a character to have basic topical knowledge of the applicable realm of expertise, and to use Scrolls, Wands, Fetishes, and similar &quot;spell completion&quot; items keyed to the applicable category of magic. However, this level of ability is insufficient for a character to cast spells.</p>
<h3 id="psionics-ki-spell-like-abilities">Psionics, Ki &amp; Spell-like Abilities</h3>
<p>These guideline can also be applied to characters using <strong>Focused</strong> to accomplish Psionics, Wuxia style ki / chi abilities, spell-like abilities, or other similar not-exactly-magic-but-may-as-well-be effects, with merely a change of theme.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="option-a-few-known-spells">Option: A Few Known Spells</h4>
<p>Effects more powerful than cantrips are beyond the +2 level of ability (unless the character is taking advantage of the <a href="#prepared-casting">Prepared Casting</a> Option, trading the ability to free cast more spells for increased potency and reliability).</p>
<p>But to allow a character to get concrete benefit out of a +2 in one of these Archetypes without lowering the bar on access to serious magic, the GM can allow a player to define between two and five minor &quot;1st level&quot; equivalent spells / prayers that their character knows and is able to use per these guidelines.</p>
<p>Such a character might be able to &quot;learn&quot; more minor spells as they discover them in their travels, until such a time as the character gains a +3 in their Archetype and graduates to master status and can freely cast spells.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Adventures/DawnOfTheShatteredStar/Chapters/Chapter2/Skoth/Skoth.aspx">Skoth</a>, a character with Arcane +2, demonstrates this option.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="spellcasting-classes">Spellcasting Classes</h2>
<p>The degree of strict or open-ended adherence to the source material is left open to a given GM or group's preferences.</p>
<p>However, by default within this material the clearly delineated classes of the source material are not being imprinted on Fate Accelerated as anything other than inspiration.</p>
<p>So for instance &quot;Wizard&quot; vs &quot;Sorcerer&quot; vs &quot;Witch&quot; vs &quot;Magus&quot; vs all the many and sundry prestige classes and variants is meaningful only to the extent that it is echoed within a character's Aspects, choice of Stunts, and general flavor; functionally it is all just Arcane.</p>
<h3 id="source-material-as-inspiration">Source Material As Inspiration</h3>
<p>Players and the GM are free to think up and suggest their own spell effects, but on top of that the source material (i.e. Pathfinder) provides copious spell lists to draw inspiration from and also to suggest what sorts of effects are permissible.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>The <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/">Pathfinder System Reference Document</a> provides an online reference library of all the open licensed content, including spell lists and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells">hundreds of spells</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>In many cases, a spell's name taken directly from the source material or something extrapolated from it can be used straight up as the name for a situational Aspect with an agreed upon meaning interpreted from the spell's effect in the source material. There is nothing wrong with this approach, and it can allow players familiar with any version of D&amp;D to boldly proclaim things like <strong><em>&quot;I cast Wall Of Fire!&quot;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&quot;Sleep!&quot;</em></strong> or <strong><em>&quot;Explosive Runes!&quot;</em></strong> without requiring a lot of up front discussion about what that actually means.</p>
<h3 id="justification">Justification</h3>
<p>Pathfinder FAE takes the general stance that &quot;classes&quot; and the categorization of magic into Arcane, Divine, Primal is partially just fluff and flavor, and partially an artifact of a regimented &quot;class and level&quot; system.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder FAE premise is that what really matters in all things is <strong>NARRATIVE JUSTIFICATION</strong>, capitalized for effect because it is <em>really important</em>.</p>
<p>For purposes of spellcasting, the most important question to be asked is <em>&quot;What narrative effects does this particular spellcaster's concept justify?&quot;</em>. If a given spell feels out of character for a given spellcaster, it should be taken as a sign that something is amiss.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Pro Tip: for a given spellcasting character constantly ask, &quot;given this character's concept and past exploits, what effects on the narrative are &quot;in bounds&quot; or &quot;out of bounds&quot; for them when using their magic?&quot;.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="tale-of-the-tape">Tale Of The Tape</h2>
<p>Generally, Pathfinder FAE suggests that a player of a magic using character attempting to introduce a new spell or effect to the narrative should first consider if there is anything in their character's Aspects, Stunts, Approach allocations, and how the character has been portrayed thus far that suggests that the spell or effect is or should be part of their character's repertoire.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Pro Tip: If a player tries to justify a spell or effect and the GM and / or other players do not think it sounds legit, that is direct feedback that the rest of the group does not consider the effect of the spell to be &quot;in bounds&quot; for the character.</p>
<p>Often times, one or more suggestions of an effect that people feel is more appropriate to the character and the situation might be forthcoming from the rest of the table.</p>
</div>
<p>If a given group is trying to adhere to the source material pretty closely, they will already have some notions about what kind of &quot;spells&quot; are and are not in bounds for a &quot;Wizard&quot; or a &quot;Cleric&quot; or a &quot;Druid&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Does it make sense that a &quot;Wizard&quot; can hurl a lightning bolt from his hands? The source material says yes.</p>
<p>A &quot;Cleric&quot;? The source material generally says no, but if they have an Aspect analogous to the &quot;Lightning Domain&quot;, then sure.</p>
<p>A &quot;Druid&quot;? The source material says...not exactly...but they can pull a lightning bolt down from the sky for a similar effect because that fits their shtick of &quot;manipulating the environment&quot; better.</p>
<p>However, the concepts of the source material can be followed as closely as the play group desires, or not at all. Whatever makes for a more engaging game for that group is the correct way to go.</p>
<h3 id="omnipotence-is-narratively-boring">Omnipotence Is Narratively Boring</h3>
<p>Though it might seem unintuitive, players should consider that a spellcaster that can cast any spell they want any time they like is actually quite boring from a narrative perspective as they can't be properly challenged and thus there is no dramatic tension involved in that character's evolving story.</p>
<p>Generally characters that have a well defined shtick and work within it to find clever solutions tend to be more relatable and narratively interesting, and this is as true for a magic using character as any other Archetype.</p>
<h3 id="gm-veto">GM Veto</h3>
<p>While Pathfinder FAE players have a tremendous amount of agency to define their own character concept and pursue lines of play that are interesting to them, ultimately if they find it necessary to do so the GM can veto a spell or effect that they do not think is narratively justified in a given scene, or that they think is out of bounds for a given character.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Pro Tip: GM veto should be exercised with care. There is a fine balance to maintain between permissiveness in the interests of fun vs. protecting the long term health of a campaign.</p>
</div>
<p>A GM that doesn't feel comfortable saying &quot;No&quot;, or who is ok with a particular effect being used occasionally but not always, can just dial the difficulty up a few notches.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Pro Tip: a generally more interesting way to handle things (assuming they are not potentially plot-destroying) is for the GM to &quot;say Yes&quot;, but raise the difficulty commensurately to how unlikely they think success should be. The player can then decide if they still want to make the attempt, or change their mind.</p>
</div>
<p>But even a GM that is reluctant to say &quot;No&quot; can and should veto any effect that ruins the fun of the game for the group as a whole or jeopardizes the long term health of the game.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Pro Tip: The GM should beware of effects that assert game mechanics over the narrative as they can strongly erode the point of using a narrative system such as Fate Accelerated in the first place.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="martial-caster-disparity">Martial / Caster Disparity</h2>
<p>By default, there is no &quot;martial / caster disparity&quot; in Fate Accelerated. A &quot;wizard&quot; using magic to attack, overcome, create advantage, or defend is using the same four actions as a &quot;fighter&quot; using their martial competence to attack, overcome, create advantage, or defend.</p>
<p>However, all of that intrinsic balance pivots on the fulcrum of justification. A character that can justify nearly anything can attempt more things than a character that can only justify a narrow range of things, and thus will have more overall impact on the story as their relevance to unfolding events is higher.</p>
<p>A more narrowly defined character that cannot justify very many effects might still be more reliable within their specialty, but will have a difficult time remaining relevant in the long term.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Pro Tip: if a GM finds that after a while most of their players seem to want to play some kind of spellcaster, they should ask themselves if they are being too lenient with what they allow magic users to justify, or too strict on what they allow non-spellcasters justify.</p>
<p>Non-mystical characters with high <strong>Combatives</strong>, <strong>Roguish</strong>, and <strong>Focused</strong> should be equally able to justify impressive effects appropriate to their shticks as spellcasters can within theirs.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus if spellcasting is allowed to be a blank check that can justify anything, and non-spellcasters are prohibited from using their abilities in similarly flexible ways, the classic martial / caster disparity will rear its head once again despite the system itself not asserting it.</p>
<h2 id="approaches-with-magic">Approaches With Magic</h2>
<p>With narrative support, just about any Approach can theoretically be used for any sort of magic. However, there is synergy to be had by at least loosely tying certain kinds of spell effects to thematically appropriate Approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Careful</strong> is good for rituals and spells that require fiddly components and precision, and conjurations.</p>
<p><strong>Clever</strong> is good for divinations and crafty transmutations, and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Flashy</strong> is good for area affecting magic, prismatic spells and anything big, loud, colorful, or otherwise splashy and obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Forceful</strong> is good for direct attacks and flat assertions or negations such as some abjuration effects.</p>
<p><strong>Quick</strong> is good for simple effects, charms or other effects mixed in with a mundane activity, and reactive / defensive magic.</p>
<p><strong>Sneaky</strong> is good for illusions, some enchantments, shadow magic, shapechanging magic used to deceive, and magic that lacks obvious tell-tales.</p>
<h2 id="defend-with-magic">Defend With Magic</h2>
<p>Each mystic Archetype can be used to <strong>Defend</strong> against itself. If one character uses Arcane to attack another character, the target can defend with Arcane, and so on. It's as simple as that. You can think of this as &quot;counter-magic&quot;, or a &quot;saving throw&quot;, or just a neat feature of the rules as you like.</p>
<p>If a character wants to use a Archetype to defend across a different Archetype vector like Divine types who want their &quot;god to protect them&quot; against non-Divine threats, or an Arcanist who wants to gain some physical protection from their Arcane skills without having to spend actions setting up &quot;protective spells&quot; via Create Advantage (and so on) a Stunt can be taken to enable that. For instance:</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong>: Because I have mastered protecting myself with magic, I may use Arcane to defend against physical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Aegis</strong>: Because my patron deity protects me I may use Divine to defend against non-Divine magical and unusual attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Resistance</strong>: Because my primal nature and elemental affinity protects me, I may use Primal to defend against non-Primal magical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="attack-with-magic">Attack With Magic</h2>
<p>Damage spells are generally just resolved using the <strong>Attack</strong> action. It usually doesn't need to be any more complicated than that. Describe the nature of the attack, choose the Approach that seems to best apply to the situation, the caster adds that Approach to their relevant mystical Archetype, and rolls 4dF.</p>
<p>Range is fiddly as spells in the source material vary widely and Fate Accelerated abstracts such things.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb it is useful to assume that <strong>attack spells can target opponents within the same zone or an adjacent zone</strong>.</p>
<p>A caster has the option to either take a one (1) shift penalty or spend an extra exchange of &quot;casting&quot; for each additional two (2) zones of distance.</p>
<h3 id="higher-level-attack-spells">Higher Level Attack Spells?</h3>
<p>There aren't larger dice or bigger dice pools involved, so there's no point to stratification with &quot;higher level&quot; spells that do more damage than &quot;lower levels&quot; spells. A character with Arcane +5 adds two (2) more shifts than a character with Arcane +3 and thus inflicts two extra shifts of stress on average. Higher Archetype means more damage, basically.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-targets">Multiple Targets</h3>
<p>Fate Accelerated handles affecting multiple targets by rolling for effect and then splitting shifts to allocate to multiple targets. This seems to create a bit of a friction point, as in the source material many spellcaster's main combat advantage is the ability to blow up groups of enemies with spells like Fireball and Chain Lightning.</p>
<p>Depending on how the GM treats &quot;mooks&quot; (nameless opponents), this isn't necessarily an actual issue. If the GM opts to treat a pack of nameless opponents as a single mob, the narrative effect of a Fireball type effect isn't lost as the mob's shared stress track respresents multiple notional &quot;targets&quot;.</p>
<p>Regardless, it will often prove inefficient to split shifts between nameless mooks and named NPC's with full write ups. For one, named characters with the standard array of consequences are durable in Fate Accelerated, benefiting from a good deal of &quot;plot protection&quot;. Secondly, from a pragmatic perspective, a capable named NPC with a full write up will often be able to defend against a measly few shifts of damage.</p>
<p>Yet, again, this isn't necessarily the end of the story. It is fully expected that many named NPC's with full write ups are important enough to the story (else, why bother with full write ups), that the GM will often have them concede should consequences start piling up. Character death is a narrative decision in Fate Accelerated, and this is as true for significant NPC's as it is for player characters. Thus, even though it is unlikely to take a significant opponent out, spreading some shifts around with big splashy magical attacks can still encourage concessions.</p>
<h3 id="zone-effect">Zone Effect</h3>
<p>It may sometimes be allowed to cast a spell that attacks everyone in a zone, but this can be very powerful and must be handled carefully. Many GM's may not want to allow it within the context of a free-casting magic system where a spellcaster could whip out such effects at will, and it is the default assumption of Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that zone affecting attacks are out of bounds for characters.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>A GM might allow a character using the <a href="#prepared-casting">Prepared Casting</a> option to prepare one or more attack spells that affect a zone. If so, such spells do not benefit from the &quot;double your Arcane bonus&quot; prepared casting beneft. Care should still be taken to monitor such spells to avoid a &quot;caster / martial&quot; disparity.</p>
</div>
<p>Instead, one or more Stunts can be taken which impose a frequency of use such as once per conflict or once per session, and / or a cost to the user such as a Fate point or a conseqence.</p>
<p>Non spell casters can take this sort of Stunt as well, to demonstrate martial prowess or unusual competence. For instance, <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Suki/Suki.aspx">Suki</a> demonstrates this option.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Chained Lightning</strong>: Because I am able to project a bolt of lighting that jumps from target to target, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fireburst</strong>: Because I am able to cause a mystical explosion to occur, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all targets in up to two contiguous adjacent zones without having to split my shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mana Bolts</strong>: Because I am able to launch target-seeking magical bolts, when I am Cleverly Arcane and attack I may spend a Fate point <strong>or</strong> suffer the Mild Consequence <strong>Spell Fatigue</strong> to affect all enemy targets in an adjacent zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="boosts">Boosts!</h3>
<p>Players of spellcasting characters should consider taking advantage of the Succeed with Style option on Attacks to do one (1) shift less damage to get a boost. With a little narrative flair, interesting boosts can be used to add some &quot;magical&quot; flavor to an otherwise straightforward numerical outcome.</p>
<h2 id="overcome-with-magic">Overcome With Magic</h2>
<p>Whenever a caster wants to use their magic as the justification to get past something, solve a problem, remove a situational Aspect, etc, it is typically just a standard use of the <strong>Overcome</strong> action.</p>
<p>This is useful for a wide variety of problem-solving spells, like Dispel, or Knock (using magic to pick a lock, basically), or divining things, or quickly charming a NPC to get past them, and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="beware-of-the-universal-tool">Beware Of The Universal Tool</h3>
<p>This use of magic is the simplest to deal with mechanically, and quickly resolved in most cases, but it is this facet of magic that has the potential to allow spellcasters to dominate play. If magic takes on the role of a &quot;universal tool&quot; able to solve any problem, it particularly steps on Roguish abilities. This is a common problem for magic systems in general, but particularly &quot;free-form&quot; cast on the fly models where there is no real opportunity cost or need to guess what will be needed ahead of time.</p>
<p>However, for purposes of Fate Accelerated a GM can solve for this potential pitfall pretty easily. The most direct and reliable way is to simply set the difficulty +2 higher (or more) when a character uses magic to Overcome something that would more typically be solved via mundane abilities. Thus, there is a real reason to do it the &quot;hard way&quot;; it is more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>A second less reliable but often times more limiting restriction is to disallow the usage of certain Approaches when using magic to Overcome some tasks...particularly <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, if it is obvious when a character is using magic to solve a problem in lieu of mundane proficiency, it helps protect the Roguish bailiwick of doing things without being seen doing them. For instance, just strolling up to a guard and Flashily casting a charm spell on them to gain access to whatever they are guarding has a wildly different possible narrative outcome than a skilled con artist trying the same thing by bluffing or bribing their way in.</p>
<h2 id="create-advantage">Create Advantage</h2>
<p>Magic that asserts a fact to be true, interacts with or alters some fundamental trait (i.e. Aspects), modifies the environment, creates some pervasive long term effect, or otherwise does something lasting, is typically &quot;cast&quot; by using a <strong>Create Advantage</strong> action to apply a situational Aspect to a target, such as the caster, another character, an object, or the scene itself.</p>
<p>Note, this kind of situational Aspect is referred to as a <strong>spell Aspect</strong> herein.</p>
<h2 id="limit-on-the-number-of-spell-aspects">Limit On The Number Of Spell Aspects</h2>
<p>To keep magic users from getting out of hand by just &quot;buffing&quot; themselves or their allies with a bunch of spell Aspects, as a general rule a character can have a number of spell Aspects equal to their Archetype active at the same time. Creating a new spell Aspect beyond that limit causes one of the in play spell Aspects of the player's choice to be cancelled and removed from play.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>Thus a character with Arcane +3 can maintain three (3) active spell Aspects at the same time, while an advanced character with Divine +5 can maintain five (5) active spell Aspects simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<p>Spell Aspects gained from other casters or items like Scrolls do not count against this limit.</p>
<h2 id="spellcasting-difficulties">Spellcasting Difficulties</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, creating spell Aspects is just a Create Advantage action and thus the GM simply assesses a base difficulty per their discretion. Generally the difficulty for a spell Aspect will be based upon how powerful or pervasive the effect that the Aspect is meant to represent is.</p>
<p>However, these guidelines make some assumptions that extra shifts will be available to apply additional attributes to spell Aspects, so GM's using these guidelines are encouraged to be somewhat lenient and not go much above a Superb (+5) difficulty even for high end effects if the caster is unopposed.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-source-materials-spell-lists-as-inspiration">Using the Source Material's Spell Lists As Inspiration</h3>
<p>If using one or more spell lists as inspiration, as a convenient rule of thumb if the caster is unopposed assume a base difficulty of Mediocre (+0), and add <strong>half of the source material's spell level of the effect being approximated, rounding up</strong>.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>Thus, assuming the caster is unopposed, to create a spell Aspect based on a 1st or 2nd level spell from the source material would be an Average (+1) difficulty, while creating a spell Aspect based on a 3rd or 4th level spell would be a Fair (+2) difficulty, and creating a spell Aspect based on a 9th level spell would be a Superb (+5) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<p>However, it is important to remember that this is just a rule of thumb, not a carved in stone mandate. The GM should feel free to set difficulties based upon their sense of how impactful a given create advantage outcome might be, particularly considering that the spellcasting character's player will likely want to use such an effect more than once over the course of a campaign.</p>
<h3 id="setting-a-difficulty-is-also-setting-a-precedent">Setting A Difficulty Is Also Setting A Precedent</h3>
<p>The first time a new spell effect is introduced, it puts the GM on the spot to come up with a workable difficulty. This can be somewhat problematic as the difficulty chosen will become the precedent the next time someone casts the same spell or a similar one as casting the same spell under the same conditions should generally be the same difficulty. Thus setting a difficulty too high or too low relative to the impact of the spell, creates problems over time.</p>
<p>As the GM, just try to err on the side of consistency and sustainability; i.e. set a difficulty that isn't so low it creates later problems when the spell is cast again, nor so high relative to its effect that no one wants to use the spell anymore as the risk vs reward is upside down.</p>
<p>Generally, players will be more receptive if you later reduce the difficulty to cast a particular kind of spell rather than if you go the opposite direction and assert a higher difficulty on a spell they've gotten used to casting at a lower difficulty. Thus if you are on the spot and feel like a spell should be a little more difficult to cast, go ahead and bump the difficulty up by +1 or even +2 and see how it goes...if it proves to not be egregious as you feared you can ratchet the difficulty down later.</p>
<h3 id="success">Success!</h3>
<p>The normal rules for Create Advantage apply; successfully creating a spell Aspect grants one (1) free invoke, and succeeding with style grants an extra free invoke for two (2) total free invocations.</p>
<p>But in addition to the normal success outcomes, a spellcaster also gets to apply the extra shifts they rolled for further benefit.</p>
<p>Shifts get split up in various ways to increase duration (two (2) extra shifts per one (1) time increment up the scale), base difficulty for other characters to Overcome and remove the spell Aspect (one (1) extra shift per one (1) higher difficulty), extra invokes (two (2) extra shifts per one (1) extra invoke), and so forth as seems to make sense in the moment.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Players can keep simple notes on the spell Aspects their characters have used before with assessed difficulties and basic effects for future reuse.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="spell-aspect-base-difficulties-to-overcome">Spell Aspect Base Difficulties To Overcome</h3>
<p>Each spell Aspect requires some interpretation on the part of the GM, but if a spell Aspect creates a situation that can be overcome the spell Aspect has a base difficulty equal to the difficulty to cast it. The spellcaster may apply extra shifts to increase the base difficulty.</p>
<p><strong><em>One (1) extra shift can be applied to raise the difficulty to overcome a spell Aspect by one (1), any number of times.</em></strong></p>
<p>For instance, a spell with a difficulty of Superb (+5) to cast would also present at least a Superb (+5) difficulty to overcome for anyone attempting to get rid of the Aspect. To raise the difficulty to overcome the spell Aspect to Legendary (+8) would take three (3) extra shifts.</p>
<h4 id="level-of-effect">Level Of Effect</h4>
<p>Many spell Aspects that affect the scene or other characters can be thought of as having a <strong>'level of effect'</strong>, with some being more powerful than others based upon the skill of the caster and how well or poorly the spell Aspect was cast.</p>
<p>Unless specifically noted otherwise in a spell Aspect's description, if it is necessary to determine how much effect the Aspect has when it interacts with the scene or a character, treat the spell Aspect's level of effect as being equal to its difficulty to overcome.</p>
<p>For instance, a spell Aspect with a Legendary (+8) difficulty to overcome is assumed to also have a Legendary (+8) level of effect unless a different level of effect is specifically described for the spell.</p>
<h3 id="extra-invokes">Extra Invokes</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, spell Aspects function exactly like any other Aspect, offering narrative flavor but needing to be invoked to provide any mechanical benefit or to activate.</p>
<p>And though some spell Aspects are primarily passive and mainly serve to establish a fact (such as <strong>Invisibility</strong> or <strong>Flight</strong>), they can still reasonably be invoked for a bonus when applicable like any other Aspect.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, success grants a free invoke and succeeding with style grants a total of two (2) free invokes, but extra shifts beyond success can be allocated to get additional free invokes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Two (2) extra shifts can be applied for one (1) additional free invoke, any number of times.</em></strong></p>
<p>Thus if a spellcaster succeeded with style to create a spell Aspect for two (2) total free invokes but got +4 more than they needed to succeed on their 4dF roll, they could apply the extra shifts for two (2) additional free invokes...a total of four (4) invokes!</p>
<h3 id="spell-aspect-durations">Spell Aspect Durations</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, spell Aspect are usually situational Aspects placed on a target. The target can be a character, a zone, the scene itself, or any other legal target for an Aspect.</p>
<p>Guidelines are provided for how long spell Aspects last. However, the narrative always trumps extended duration; <strong>if it no longer makes sense</strong> for a spell Aspect to exist, it is removed regardless of any other factor.</p>
<h4 id="active-spell-aspect-durations">Active Spell Aspect Durations</h4>
<p>Spell Aspects that are direct or overt rather than passive must be actively invoked to have a meaningful effect, but they usually stick around until discharged (have no further invokes remaining) even past the end of scenes. However, they are usually removed from play immediately once they are out of invokes. Their duration can thus be extended by gaining more free invokes.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, a <strong>Mystical Shield</strong> spell that must be invoked to grant a +2 bonus on a Defend action, or a <strong>Flaming Sword</strong> spell that must be invoked to grant a +2 bonus on an Attack action would generally last as long as they have invokes remaining, but dissipate as soon as their last invoke is used.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="passive-spell-aspect-durations">Passive Spell Aspect Durations</h4>
<p>On the other hand, spell Aspects that are fairly passive and assert facts into the narrative might last for a scene and possibly longer unless they are overcome or the narrative suggests that they should be removed.</p>
<p>Passive spell Aspects that simply assert facts on the narrative can have their duration increased by allocating two (2) extra shifts per time increment, or as negotiated with the GM.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>Thus a spell caster could apply two (2) shifts to make a passive spell Aspect stick around for two (2) scenes.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="action-proxies">Action Proxies</h3>
<p>For more sophisticated spells, it can be useful to use Create Advantage to create a spell Aspect that can then be invoked later (or triggered by a narrative event) to cause an Attack, Defend, Overcome, or even a different Create Advantage action to occur.</p>
<p>To do this, a spellcaster describes the effect they are going for and what action will be proxied. If the GM agrees, the caster then use Create Advantage as normal.</p>
<p>However in addition to the things that extra shifts can be allocated towards, the caster may also allocate some number of shifts to the proxied action they are attaching to the spell Aspect. The number of shifts allocated to the proxied action provide the bonus that will be applied to the proxied action's 4dF roll when it is activated later.</p>
<p>If the caster succeeds with style they can choose to gain +1 extra shift instead of an extra invocation of the proxied action if that makes more sense for the spell in question.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Voxel/Voxel.aspx">Voxel</a> uses a Create Advantage action while Sneakily Arcane to attach the <strong>Exploding Runes</strong> spell Aspect to a location. Narratively, he has inscribed Explosive Runes underneath a carefully placed book such that when a victim picks up the book the Runes explode!</p>
<p>The GM sets the Difficulty at Fair (+2). Voxel rolls ++-[], and adds his <strong>Sneaky + Arcane</strong> bonus of +5 for a total of +6. Voxel needed +2 to succeed, so he has 4 extra shifts; he also succeeded with style and opts for +1 shift. Therefore the Explosive Rune spell Aspect has 5 shifts of effect embedded in it, and will make an Attack roll at +5 whenever it gets triggered later. After it is triggered, the spell Aspect is removed from the scene.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="conjuration-and-summoning">Conjuration And Summoning</h2>
<p>The source material has a variety of spells that summon an ally or monster to serve the caster's will. Other spells don't summon a creature per se but do create some kind of construct that acts independently from the caster.</p>
<p>For convenience, let's call this sort of &quot;summoned&quot; or &quot;called&quot; or &quot;conjured&quot; character a <strong>servitor</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be tricky in Fate Accelerated, as the rules don't really cover followers or sidekicks and the like. There is also the concern that a spellcaster summoning minions has a force multiplying effect, and also that they can summon minions that offer skill-like abilities or Stunts that step on the roles of other characters. Basically, this sort of effect will require quite a lot more adjudication than most other spells.</p>
<h3 id="servitors">Servitors</h3>
<p>Servitors are basically mooks, with a few differences. Like mooks, they have a simplified profile, and a write-up can represent either an individual or a &quot;mob&quot; that acts together as a group.</p>
<p>Any spellcaster can summon a servitor, regardless of whether they are <strong>Arcane</strong>, <strong>Divine</strong>, or <strong>Primal</strong> based. Generally, summoning a servitor is done while being <strong>Careful</strong>.</p>
<p>A servitor is summoned by casting a spell using the Create Advantage action to attach a spell Aspect to a scene, the caster themselves, or some other viable target as makes sense. The difficulty to summon a servitor starts at Mediocre (+0), and goes up for more powerful servitors.</p>
<p>Mechanically, the servitor spell Aspect anchors the servitor to the target. It can also be dispelled or removed by characters with appropriate abilities or narrative justification using the overcome action; the difficulty to do so is left to the GM's discretion but usually would be equal to the difficulty required to summon the servitor.</p>
<p>Descriptively, a servitor summoned in this way might appear or arrive in whatever manner suits the narrative or concept.</p>
<p>A spellcaster can reduce the difficulty to summon a servitor by spending extra exchanges prior to making the attempt. Each exchange spent &quot;casting&quot;, neither moving or taking some other action, prior to making the 4dF check to create the servitor spell Aspect grants a +1 bonus to the roll.</p>
<h4 id="baseline-servitor">Baseline Servitor</h4>
<p>A baseline servitor gets two Aspects, uses a simple hit box track starting at zero (0) hit boxes, has one (1) skill-like ability that they are good at (+2) or two (2) skill-like abilities they are fair at (+1 each), and are either bad at one (1) thing (-2) or poor at two (2) things (-1 each).</p>
<p>The difficulty for summoning a baseline servitor is Mediocre (+0).</p>

<h4 id="servitor-upgrades">Servitor Upgrades</h4>
<p>Servitors can be improved upon from the default baseline, but the summoning difficulty that must be overcome to summon an upgraded servitor increases commensurately.</p>
<p>The Servitor Improvements chart details how much additional difficulty is incurred per upgrade. The difficulty increases are cumulative, and round up.</p>
<p>As a convenience, the difficulty to summon a servitor can be annotated on the servitor write-up.</p>
<p>Upgraded servitors can be written up on the fly as needed, but to avoid slowing play a GM might require all servitors to be written up and approved outside of play time. Existing mook write-ups may be repurposed as servitors by adding up the mook's upgrades to determine the difficulty. Characters with full write-ups are not mooks and thus cannot be used as servitors.</p>

<h5 id="obedient-servitor">Obedient Servitor</h5>
<p>A servitor is not necessarily obedient to their summoner, but an <strong>Obedient</strong> or <strong>Loyal</strong> or similar Aspect can be added to a servitor to ensure compliancy.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-servitor">Spellcasting Servitor</h5>
<p>A servitor can be a spellcaster, but must have a relevant skill-like ability at +3 or better.</p>
<h5 id="servitor-autonomy-and-initiative">Servitor Autonomy and Initiative</h5>
<p>Servitors act on their own, but unless they have a skill-like ability, Aspect, or Stunt that suggests otherwise, they have initiative 0.</p>
<h5 id="stress-boxes-vs-hit-boxes">Stress Boxes vs Hit Boxes</h5>
<p>By default, the baseline servitor has zero (0) hit boxes; however it can be upgraded to have more, with every two additional hit boxes increasing the difficulty to summon the servitor by +1. There is no cap on how many hit boxes a servitor might have.</p>
<p>A servitor can have stress boxes instead of hit boxes if desired. Each additional stress box increases the difficulty to summon the servitor by +1. The stress boxes follow the normal progression of <strong>[1][2][3]</strong>, must be taken in order, and are capped at [3].</p>
<p>A servitor that has a full stress track (<strong>[1][2][3]</strong>) can have a Mild consequence, raising the difficulty to summon the servitor by +1.</p>
<p>A servitor that has a Mild consequence may also have a Moderate consequence, raising the difficulty to summon the servitor by +1.</p>
<p>A servitor that has a Moderate consequence may also have a Severe consequence, raising the difficulty to summon the servitor by +1 once again.</p>
<p>A servitor with a full stress and consequences allotment is approximately as durable as a full character write up, and may or may not be able to concede a conflict at the GM's discretion.</p>
<h5 id="hindrances">Hindrances</h5>
<p>Servitors can have additional &quot;Bad At&quot; penalties at the GM's discretion, each -1 penalty reduces the difficulty required to summon the servitor by -1. However, the GM should ensure that any such penalties taken are actually relevant and not a min-maxing attempt by a player.</p>
<p>Servitors can also have various restrictions upon themselves or upon the summoning of them; such restrictions lower the difficulty to cast the summoning spell by a variable amount. What constitutes a valid restriction and how much it lowers the difficulty to summon the servitor is left to the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>Servitors can reduce the default &quot;Bad At&quot; penalty the baseline begins with; each -1 removed raises the summoning difficulty by +1.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Tamara/Tamara.aspx">Tamara</a> is Carefully Arcane and uses a Create Advantage action while Carefully Arcane to attach the <strong>Murder Of Crows</strong> spell Aspect to the scene.</p>
<p>Tamara has summoned a Murder of Crows before and thus there is an existing write-up; otherwise one would be created on the fly.</p>
<p>Compared to a baseline servitor, the Murder of Crows has some hit boxes, an extra Aspect, and an extra Good At bonus, which collectively raises the difficulty to summon such a servitor from Mediocre (+0) to Good (+3).</p>
<p>Tamara adds her <strong>Careful + Arcane</strong> bonus to a 4dF roll and in this scenario succeeds at casting the spell. Narratively she utters a disturbing command, and a swarm of oily black feathered birds converges upon the area to do Tamara's bidding.</p>

<h2 id="save-or-bad">Save Or Bad</h2>
<p>The source material has a variety of &quot;make a saving throw or a very bad thing happens&quot; effects, up to and including the infamous Save Or Die effects. Fate Accelerated generally does not lend itself to such extreme and non-narrative outcomes, taking the stance that such absolute and capricious effects are not fun and have a lot of potential to wreck a story for no good reason other than randomness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many of the Save Or Bad type effects can reasonably be handled as simple Attacks, with applicable narrative interpretation if Consequences are suffered. Particularly vs &quot;mooks&quot;, who are generally not very durable.</p>
<p>Against mooks, it is often possible to simply make a magic based Attack and narrate the outcome per the Save Or Bad effect. By this reasoning if you wipe out a mook or damage a mob of mooks, it doesn't really matter mechanically if you describe the effect as straightforward damage or something more esoteric such as disintegration or petrification or banishment.</p>
<p>However named characters with full write ups including standard stress and consequences generally can not be taken out in one shot from full health, and will thus be largely exempt from such instant death alpha strike effects.</p>
<p>From a narrative perspective this is actually a good thing; it prevents significant NPCs and by extension even entire scenes from getting anticlimactically one-shotted out of the session. It is also in the player characters' best interests in the long run as they enjoy the same protection. Think of characters with full write ups (vs mook write ups) as having built in plot protection, or if you must, as having a better &quot;saving throw&quot; than mere minions.</p>
<p>But Save vs Bad effects can still provide inspiration for creative Consequences. For instance a &quot;Save vs Petrification&quot; effect could be represented as an attack spell, and if a Consequence is applied to the target as a result of the attack a petrification theme would be applied. A relevant Mild Consequence might be <strong>Stoned Reflexes</strong>, a Moderate Consequence might be <strong>Stiffened Joints and Pebbly Skin</strong>, and a Severe Consequence might be <strong>Partialy Petrified</strong>.</p>
<p>Applying some creative interpretation to Consequences and concessions in this way opens up a lot of options for handling some of the more powerful and arbitrarily absolute abilities in the source material. However, to prevent abuse the GM might want to enforce some opportunity costs around this kind of overt Consequence manipulation.</p>
<h3 id="consequence-manipulation">Consequence Manipulation</h3>
<p>At the GM's discretion, particularly strong, advantageous, or specific Consequence manipulating abilities or spell Aspects might also require a character to invest in a Stunt clearly defining how they are able to impose a Consequence and what benefit they gain from it.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Domination (-2)</strong>: Because of my mastery of mind-affecting enchantments, while I am Forcefully Arcane I can make mental attacks against a living target in my zone or an adjacent zone. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against the target's nature. If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Necromantic Enervation</strong>: Because I am a master of necromancy, I am able to drain the life energy from others. While I am Sneakily Arcane I can attack others with 'Life Draining' spells; in addition to the stress if I inflict a Consequence on my target I afflict them with enervation and ennui. Consequences such as <strong>Easily Fatigued</strong>, <strong>Fits Of Ennui</strong>, <strong>Prone To Depression</strong>, and <strong>Sunk Into A Deep Funk</strong> cause those afflicted to struggle to motivate and empower themselves, to unexpectedly lose interest in being active, become unconcerned about succeeding in their endeavors, and so forth. If a target is taken out in this way, they die and rise again as an Undead minion that I can control for the remainder of the scene and possibly longer at the GM's discretion.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Empathy</strong>: Because I am a master of enchantment magics that allow me to manipulat the emotional states of others, while I am Cleverly Arcane I can engage a target in a social conflict and if I inflict a Consequence I can afflict them with a propensity for a specific emotion. Consequences such as <strong>Fits Of Uncontrollable Rage</strong>, <strong>Plunged Into Deep Sadness</strong>, <strong>Gripped By Passionate Love</strong>, and <strong>Overwhelmed By Euphoric Happiness</strong> incite those afflicted to act out in ways appropriate to the emotional state I have imposed on them. If, while I share a scene with the target, a Consequences I have inflicted with this ability is compelled and the target spends a fate point to refuse the compel, I gain the fate point immediately.</p>

<h1 id="simple-magic-options">Simple Magic Options</h1>
<p>This section collects options to expand the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a> with more complicated elements. A group might use none, some, or all of the offered options as they see fit.</p>
<h2 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h2>
<p>Any magic user might use trappings like a scroll for cosmetic purposes, or scrolls and similar items can just be handled as a purely narrative consideration.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have more detailed Scroll write ups with a defined effect and some number of usages. This sort of Scroll is an expendable magic item that can be acquired and carried around until expended or dropped without requiring a character to have an Aspect or Stunt to justify having it. They do however require the character to have at least +1 in the relevant mystical capability to use the Scroll.</p>
<p>When a character uses this sort of Scroll, they are actually casting the spell using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a>. Scrolls generally grant a flat +4 bonus if they require a specific Approach and Archetype combination be used while casting, or a +2 bonus if they only require a Archetype and can be used with any Approach.</p>
<p>However, and this is important, preparing a Scroll for use takes an action. Thus to cast a spell from a Scroll requires an action to get it out and prepare to use it, and an action to use it. Thus the large bonus is factored against the loss of action economy.</p>
<p>A character can declare that they are preparing a Scroll before a conflict starts if they had reason to believe that it would be adviseable to do so and had time to prepare in the scene leading up to the conflict. This indicates that the Scroll is out and opened (or on display) and the character is poised to cast from it.</p>

<p>Overcoming Spell Aspects is explained in the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic guidelines</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, as an option, a character that wants to be able to make their own Scrolls and reliably have some available to them can do so by taking a Stunt. The following example Stunt is for Arcane characters, but Divine and Primal characters could take a similar Stunt by replacing &quot;Arcane&quot; with &quot;Divine&quot; or &quot;Primal&quot;.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Scroll Scrivener</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of scribing scrolls, I can be Cleverly Arcane and prepare 'spell completion' items as scrolls or similar items for specific spell effects that I can cast. I can later cast the inscribed spell (using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guidelines</a>) from the item, gaining a bonus in the process. Other characters with Arcane +1 or better can also use my scrolls. I can also stockpile unused scrolls, as well as use scrolls inscribed by others. Unless explicitly denied means and opportunity, I can prepare a number of new scrolls ready for use equal to my Arcane capability each day.</p>
<p>NOTE: A character with this Stunt that wants to make a Scroll with two or more uses can make multiple copies of that Scroll and just annotate it as being one item with multiple uses at their discretion. Of course, expendable magic items have a Stress track and can thus be targetted and destroyed. Therefore it might be more pragmatic to keep each usage of a Scroll separate to avoid putting all of one's eggs in the same basket.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="prepared-casting">Prepared Casting</h2>
<p>A common trope of the source material is the so-called &quot;Vancian&quot; magic concept, wherein some kinds of spellcasters must &quot;prepare&quot; or &quot;memorize&quot; spells chosen from their list of &quot;known spells&quot; and / or a &quot;spellbook&quot; ahead of time, and have a limited number of slots determined by their &quot;caster level&quot; and rated in &quot;spell levels&quot;.</p>
<p>It's all a bit cumbersome, adds a lot of bookkeeping and extra verbiage, and also forces that type of character to guess what spells they'll need through the course of the day and then puts pressure on them to hoard their memorized spells like a miser. But, it does have the benefit of long familiarity, and some people enjoy the extra mental challenge and tension it instills.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows free-casting without spell per day or even hard spell level limits. This is a fast and loose style of play, and it's weighted so as to keep spellcasters roughly equivalent in potency to non-spellcasters. However, if the GM and group want to include prepared casting semantics into their game, it can be &quot;turned&quot; on for a given character at the cost of a Stunt.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>As Prepared Casting is handled as a Stunt and Fate Accelerated characters are allowed to swap Stunts at milestones, it is technically possible for strange shenanigans to come up. However, it is recommended that Prepared Casting Stunts be anchored by a character's High Concept, and can thus only be taken or removed when an appropriate High Concept is taken or changed. This equates to character creation and major milestones, and avoids casual fluctuations.</p>

<p>The below Stunt is appropriate for Arcane characters such as wizards, who must have Arcane +2 or better to qualify for it. Note that this allows a character with less than Arcane +3 to cast more than cantrips; the low number of uses and lack of free-casting compensates.</p>

<p>Later during the day I may 'cast' a prepared prayer by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the prayer using the previously rolled margin of success.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="known-spells-list">Known Spells List</h3>
<p>As a rule of thumb prepared casters start play knowing about twice as many spells as they can cast per day. Thus a prepared caster than can prepare twelve (12) spells per day would start play knowing around twentyfour (24) spells, give or take a couple. However to avoid forcing a player to go through the chore of picking them all up front, which is a bar to starting play, with the GM's permission a player can just select enough spells to start the game and retroactively add more to the list of known spells as they are thought up until they hit their limit.</p>
<p>Finally, prepared casters can learn more spells after play starts as they encounter scrolls and spellbooks. How long it takes, whether a roll is involved, hand-waved or played out...Pathfinder Fate Accelerated prefers to focus on narrative driven play and doesn't take a stance on bookkeeping minutia where it can be avoided. Therefore it is assumed to take some &quot;off screen&quot; time to learn new spells by default, but the entire matter is left to the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>Some <a href="#sample-spells">sample spells</a> are available, and players are also free to come up with their own per GM's discretion.</p>
<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-prepared-casting">Pros and Cons of Prepared Casting</h3>
<p>There are some interesting permutations to the choice to play a prepared caster. Prepared casters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a large bonus on their roll to prepare.</li>
<li>Can apply spells that they are pretty sure are going to work to a situation, because they already know how many shifts are available to the spell rather than having to hope they succeed at a 4dF roll at the time of casting.</li>
<li>Don't have to use create advantage actions when the &quot;heat is on&quot; to set up more esoteric spells, offering better action economy.</li>
<li>Get potentially far fewer spells per day than characters using the free-casting model, but as the saying goes &quot;enough is as good as a feast&quot;. Eventually a prepared caster can cast a sufficient number of spells to get through a typical session of play.</li>
<li>Excel if sessions are short as their limited number of spells is mitigated.</li>
<li>Lag if sessions are longer with multiple encounters.</li>
<li>Lag if the player guesses wrong about what will be useful, or runs out of spells too soon, or hoards their spells so tightly they end up not doing anything.</li>
</ul>
<div class="Example">
<p><strong>Prepared Casting Example</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Amarzedrin/Amarzedrin.aspx">Amarzedrin</a> can prepare up to twelve (12) spells per day. Each time he prepares a spell, he rolls 4dF and adds +8 (his Arcane bonus, doubled). One morning he prepares Fireball (and eleven (11) other spells). For the Fireball preparation he rolls ++-[] for a total of +9. Amarzedrin's player writes down the personal Aspect &quot;Prepared Fireball (+9) [ ]&quot; on a scrap of paper.</p>
<p>Because it is useful to this example, it makes sense that later in the day Amarzedrin is confronted by a couple of mobs of goblins (represented as mooks), damn the luck.</p>
<p>Deciding to not waste time and risk injury, Amarzedrin invokes Prepared Fireball. The Prepared Fireball Aspect is removed from play as it has been expended, and the nine (9) shifts from his margin of success are used to power a Fireball spell effect.</p>
<p>Amarzedrin splits his nine (9) shifts into a group of five (5) shifts and a group of four (4) shifts and allocates each set of shifts as stress to the two goblin mobs. The first group of goblins defends at +0 (they are not spellcasters, and have no relevant skill-like abilities) and roll +--- for a total of -2. Amarzedrin succeeds with style and may take a boost at the cost of a shift; but for purposes of the example he opts to just blow them up.</p>
<p>The second group of goblins is actually a goblin pyromancer and his apprentice...of course! They have a relevant Fire Magic skill-like ability at +3, and roll +++- for a total of Superb (+5), and defend successfully. Looks like Amarzedrin has a fight on his hands.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="alchemists">Alchemists</h2>
<p>Alchemists make potions, elixirs, and similar <strong>concoctions</strong> and invest magical effects into them.</p>
<p>Alchemical effects most often take the form of buffs (Potion of Giant's Strength!) and utility effects (Potion of Invisibility!), but there is no restriction to enforce that. If an effect can be made to make sense narratively, it is fair game.</p>
<h3 id="prepared-casting-alchemy">Prepared Casting (Alchemy)</h3>
<p>The ability to prepare spell-like effects in advance and use them later is functionally almost identical to the <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> model, save for the narrative difference of the effect being in item form. A version of prepared casting that uses alchemical items can be handled in much the same way, using a Stunt.</p>
<p>A character with Arcane +1 or better can take the following Stunt, thus making themselves an Alchemist. However, they lose the ability to use Arcane to cast spells directly. At the GM's discretion, this model could be extended to Divine and / or Primal as well with suitable name and &quot;chrome&quot; changes.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Prepared Caster (Alchemy):</strong></p>
<p>Because of my studies as a classically trained Alchemist, given time and opportunity I may 'prepare' a number of potions, elixirs, salves and similar 'concoctions' equal to <strong>((Careful + Clever + Focused) * Arcane)</strong>.</p>
<p>Unused concoctions remain until they get activated or destroyed and can be stockpiled. These Aspects are portable; I may give them to others and they can be taken away from me.</p>
<p>Making a concoction requires time, materials, and either a lab or a field kit; the specifics are left to the GM's discretion, but simple potions might take minutes while very powerful potions might take one or more hours.</p>
<p>If a strict economy is being enforced in the campaign, it usually costs about half retail price to make a concoction; GM's discretion applies.</p>
<p>To prepare a concoction I roll 4dF and add (Focused + Arcane) against a Mediocre (+0) difficulty; failure indicates a botched concoction and that 'slot' is wasted for the day. I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the concoction I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepared concoctions are activated by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the effect of the concoction using the previously rolled margin of success. It is possible for a concoction resolution to fail if the margin of success is insufficient to the difficulty or if opposed successfully. If I am the activator, I can spend a Fate point at this time to add +2 shifts to the margin of success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to my focus on Alchemy, I cannot free cast spells.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<p><em>Commodities</em></p>
<p>Alchemical concoctions can be given, sold to, or stolen by others and used by them. They are effectively a commodity.</p>
<p>However all of an alchemist's concoctions, including those under another character's control, count against their preparation limit.</p>
<p><em>Alchemical Item Write-ups</em></p>
<p>A variety of write-ups for [sample alchemical items] and [sample potions] are available. Each usage of these kinds of alchemical items counts against an alchemist's preparation limit.</p>
<p>Note that the provided write-ups are just examples, and not a restricted list of allowed effects; an alchemist can make any sort of alchemical item the GM allows.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p>As Prepared Casting is handled as a Stunt and Fate Accelerated characters are allowed to swap Stunts at milestones, it is technically possible for strange shenanigans to come up. However, it is recommended that Prepared Casting Stunts be anchored by a character's High Concept, and can thus only be taken or removed when an appropriate High Concept is taken or changed. This equates to character creation and major milestones, and avoids casual fluctuations.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="alchemical-dabbling">Alchemical Dabbling</h3>
<p>A character that wants to be able to make and carry around some potions (or similar spell completion items), but doesn't want to give up their ability to cast spells still has options. The most direct is to simply take advantage of the guidelines on <a href="#action-proxies">Action Proxies</a>, to create &quot;items&quot; that are really action proxies. This is neat and tidy and doesn't require any additional investment of character resources.</p>
<h4 id="prepared-casting-alchemy-dabbler">Prepared Casting (Alchemy Dabbler)</h4>
<p>A character that wants to use the prepared casting model Stunt without giving up the ability to free cast spells can take a version of the <strong>Prepared Casting (Alchemy)</strong> Stunt that offers a smaller prepared item limit but without the free casting restriction.</p>
<p>A character with Arcane +1 or better can take the following Stunt, thus making themselves an alchemist. At the GM's discretion, this model could be extended to Divine and / or Primal as well with suitable name and &quot;chrome&quot; changes.</p>

<h3 id="special-purpose-stunts">Special Purpose Stunts</h3>
<p>An ability that is thematically &quot;alchemical&quot; can be expressed as one or more Stunts that define their own function.</p>
<p>Also, it may sometimes make sense to define such a Stunt in a way that it instead interacts with a Archetype other than the character's primary spell casting Archetype, thus expanding the breadth of the kind of effects the character can use.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, in addition to being a full blown alchemist <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Xarren/Xarren.aspx">Xarren</a> has the <strong>Theriaxis</strong> Stunt that allows him to mix up magical medications with powerful and direct curative properties, which is an ability normally associated with Divine or Primal Archetypes.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Theriaxis</strong>: Because I am a dedicated scholar who has mastered highly esoteric magical and medical lore, I am able to make and apply ointments, salves, nostrums, and elixirs that can heal and repair just about any form of illness, wound, infection, or impurity. While I am Carefully Arcane and I have access to my alchemical supplies, I may clear a Stress box or clear a Consequence by overcoming a difficulty equal to the numerical value of the stress box or Consequence. If I fail to overcome the difficulty of a Consequence I may not attempt to heal that same Consequence again. I may use this ability on others as well as myself if I am able to examine and treat them. I may use this ability <strong>(Focused + Arcane)</strong> times per day. This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, the witch <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Ruelga/Ruelga.aspx">Ruelga</a> has the <strong>Potions, Poultices, Poisons</strong> Stunt which allow her to make Arcane concoctions with magical properties normally associated with Primal magics.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Potions, Poultices, Poisons</strong>: Because I know ancient lores from more primitive times, I am able to brew potions, poultices, and poisons that can harm and heal and work odd and subtle magics on those who imbide them. I can be Cleverly Arcane and make substances that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. At any given time I can have a number of substances brewed up and ready for use equal to my <strong>Arcane + Primal</strong> capability. This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="bombs">Bombs</h3>
<p>Chucking &quot;bombs&quot; or grenade-like weapons can be an effective and memorable way for an alchemist to make their presense felt when things get ugly.</p>
<p>One way to approach alchemical bombs is to treat them as merely a way to inflict stress on multiple targets.</p>
<p>It is also possible to define bombs that do other things, such as Sticky Bombs, or bombs that disrupt specific kinds of opponents such as Holy Water Vials.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Acid Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical acid bombs. - When I am Quickly Focused I gain +3 to attack a target within two (2) zones of me by throwing an alchemical acid bomb at them. - If I am successful, the acid bomb shatters, splashing its contents upon my target and inflicting damage as stress normally, but if I succeed with style, I must reduce the stress to get a boost and the boost is upgraded to the situational Aspect <strong>Acid Burn!</strong> which is attached to the target. - This Aspect is automatically invoked at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress to the target per invoke. This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty. - For a given session I can carry around and use a number of acid bombs equal to my <strong>(Clever + Arcane)</strong>. Other people can use my acid bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alchemical Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical bombs. - When I am Cleverly Focused I gain +1 to throw a bomb into my zone or an adjacent zone, generally against an Average (+1) difficulty. - If I am successful, my bomb explodes and inflicts a number of shifts of damage equal to my <strong>(Careful + Arcane)</strong> against every target in the zone without splitting shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage. - For a given session I can carry around and use a number of alchemical bombs equal to my <strong>(Clever + Arcane)</strong>. Other people can not catalyze my bombs, they are only usable by me. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Gas Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical gas bombs. - When I am Carefully Focused I gain +3 to attack a target zone within two (2) zones of me by throwing an alchemical gas bomb. - If I am successful the gas bomb shatters, releasing toxic fumes and applying the situational Aspect <strong>Toxic Gas!</strong> to the zone with two free invokes. - This Aspect is automatically invoked now and at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress per invoke to every target within the affected zone that needs to breathe. This Aspect can be removed by strong winds or focused air by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty. - For a given session I can carry around and use a number of gas bombs equal to my <strong>(Clever + Arcane)</strong>. Other people can use my gas bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Holy Water Vials</strong>: Because I have learned a special alchemical recipe, I am able to make a mildly magical mixture containing holy water, garlic, powdered silver, and grave dust that causes harm to the undead. These vials can be thrown, with the liquid splashing out upon impact to inflict harm on an undead creature. - When I am Quickly Focused I gain +4 to attack an undead target within one (1) zone of me. - If I am successful, the holy water vial shatters, splashing its contents upon my target and inflicting damage as stress normally, but this damage <strong>cannot be reduced</strong> by any innate ability of the target (other forms of protection such as a magic item or a spell do apply). - For a given session I can carry around and use a number of holy water vials equal to my <strong>(Clever + Arcane)</strong>. Other people can use my holy water vials; they still count against my per-session limit however. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sticky Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical sticky bombs. - When I am Quickly Focused I gain +3 to create advantage against a target within two (2) zones of me by throwing a sticky bomb at them. - If I am successful, the sticky bomb shatters, splashing its sticky contents upon my target, attaching the situational Aspect <strong>Trapped By Sticky Goo!</strong> to the target with three (3) invokes. - While this Aspect is in play, the target is rooted in their current zone and thus cannot move to another zone. This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+4) difficulty, but each failed attempt to overcome it expends an invoke. - This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+4) difficulty. However when it is expended or removed a second situational Aspect, <strong>Sticky Goo Residue!</strong>, is attached to the target with four (4) invokes. The second Aspect prevents the target from moving more than one (1) zone per action, and they cannot both move and attack. The second Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Superb (+6) difficulty, but each failed attempt to overcome it expends an invoke. - Note that this ability can cause flying targets to plummet to the ground if they use winged flight. - For a given session I can carry around and use a number of sticky bombs equal to my <strong>(Clever + Arcane)</strong>. Other people can use my sticky bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="mutagens">Mutagens</h3>
<p>While they may also grant secondary benefits, the fundamental nature of mutagen Stunts is to allow a character to temporarily move their Approaches and / or Archetype bonuses around to a different disposition suited to an alternate physical form.</p>
<p>This can range from &quot;hulking out&quot;, to taking on the forms and natural abilities of animals, or something more unusual.</p>
<p>As this kind of ability is unusually powerful and offers a tremendous amount of flexibility to a single character, it is usually appropriate for this sort of Stunt to cost a Fate point or have scene or session limits. However, the higher the Refresh equivalency of a Stunt the less restricted it needs to be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, GM's discretion applies heavily to this sort of ability.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Bruteform)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity, becoming much larger and stronger but at the cost of greatly diminished intellgence. - I may spend a Fate point to temporarily move all of my Approach bonuses to Forceful (leaving all of my other Approaches at +0), and to move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). I also change my Trouble to <strong>'Mutagenic Brute'</strong>. - This lasts for an entire scene unless I spend another Fate point to change back to normal. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Beastshape; -2)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity, taking on the forms of animals. - I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form. - When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). - This lasts for an entire scene unless I choose to return to normal, which ends the effect. Additionally, I may spend another Fate point to assume a different animal's form, and I do not have to first change back to normal. - When I change forms I gain an additional Aspect named for the animal form I have assumed which I can invoke when my current animal form is relevant, and which can be compelled whenever my animal form or lack of humanoid anatomy might inconvenience me. - If the animal form I change into has natural weapons I may use Focused in place of Combatives while in a physical conflict. - If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion. - If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use. :::</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Elementalform, -2)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity. I may spend <strong>two (2) Fate points</strong> to temporarily change into an Elemental. - When I activate this effect I must choose Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. - For the duration of the effect I use the Large Elemental write-up for the elemental type I have chosen instead of my own character write-up. (See <a href="#sample-mutagen-elemental-forms">sample mutagen elemental forms</a> for example elemental types.) - My transformation lasts for an entire scene but I may change back to my normal form at any time, ending the effect. - My trappings change with me and are inaccessible for the duration of the effect. - This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>

<h2 id="elementalists">Elementalists</h2>
<p>Elementalists channel the powers of the primal elements of Air, Earth, Water, and Fire.</p>
<p>Using this option, a character with Primal +3 or better and Arcane +1 or better may take any or all of the following Stunts:</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Aeromancer</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Element of Air, I may combine my Arcane and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to air, wind, lighting, weather, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Geomancer</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Element of Earth, I may combine my Arcane and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to earth, rock, seismic vibrations, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pyromancer</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Element of Fire, I may combine my Arcane and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to fire, heat, combustion, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hydromancer</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Element of Water, I may combine my Arcane and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to water, precipitation, steam, mist, liquids, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<p>These Stunts also cover the summoning of &quot;Elementals&quot;, such as Earth Elementals, Fire Elementals, and so forth, using the <a href="#conjuration-and-summoning">Conjuration And Summoning</a> guidelines.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Camren/Camren.aspx">Camren</a> is an Aeromancer.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="para-elemental">Para-Elemental</h3>
<p>A character that has two or more of these Stunts can also justify &quot;para-elemental&quot; effects. Alternately, a GM might allow a character to anchor their Elemental Stunt on a &quot;Para-elemental&quot; instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice / Cold: Air &amp; Water</li>
<li>Ooze / Mud: Water &amp; Earth</li>
<li>Magma / Lava: Earth &amp; Fire</li>
<li>Smoke / Soot: Fire &amp; Air</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="primurgy">Primurgy</h2>
<p>Using this option, a character with Primal +3 or better and Divine +1 or better may take either or both of the following Stunts:</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Valimancer / Theurge</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Primal Element of Positive Energy, the raw quintessence from which all material things are formed, I may combine my Divine and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to radiance (pure energy), healing, creation ex nihilo, directly opposing negative energy, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Voidmancer / Anatheurge</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Primal Element of Negative Energy, the void which eventually claims all things, the null state that counterpoints existence, I may combine my Divine and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to stagnation, entropy, undeath, enervation, life draining, directly opposing positive energy, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Thuvor/Thuvor.aspx">Thuvor</a> is a &quot;Demiurge&quot;, a master of both Theurgy and Anatheurgy.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="stunt-options">Stunt Options</h1>
<p>The following options are offered to expand the use of Stunts with Pathfinder Fate Accelerated. A group might use none, some, or all of the offered options as they see fit.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>A collection of <a href="#sample-stunts">sample stunts</a> is available for reference and reuse.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="general-assumptions">General Assumptions</h2>
<p>This section discusses some general assumptions taken by this material in the interests of full disclosure and to provide a solid foundation for those who are making up their own Stunts for use in a Pathfinder FAE game.</p>
<h3 id="holistic-over-stunt-parity">Holistic Over Stunt Parity</h3>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, on individual characters Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows a player to make one Stunt slightly stronger if they also opt to make one of their other Stunts slightly weaker, taking a more holistic view of the character's composite abilities. If the GM allows this, they need to be mindful of it when players swap Stunts around at milestones.</p>
<h3 id="combining-create-advantage-and-overcome">Combining Create Advantage and Overcome</h3>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows the combination of create advantage and overcome for purposes of defining Stunts wherever it makes sense to do so.</p>
<h3 id="extra-actions">Extra Actions</h3>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, with any of the Stunt templates that pin an action (attack, defend, create advantage and overcome), a character can take the same Stunt effect multiple times to apply the Stunt to more actions. This can be annotated on the character sheet with the simple shorthand of parenthetically listing the total Refresh equivalency.</p>
<p>Thus a Stunt that applied to 2 actions could be listed as <strong>Stunt Name (-2)</strong>, while a Stunt that applied to 3 actions could be listed as <strong>Stunt Name (-3)</strong>.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Veteran Of Many Wars (-2)</strong>: Because I have engaged in so much combat, I gain +1 when I am Combative and attack or defend.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bundle Of Bouncy Energy (-3)</strong>: Because I am so energetic and acrobatic, I gain +2 when I am Quickly Focused and attack, defend, create advantage, or overcome when I flip and bounce around.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="standard-stunt-templates">Standard Stunt Templates</h2>
<p>For purposes of reference and comparison, the two default Stunt templates in Fate Accelerated are provided here. These are effectively the &quot;baseline&quot; for Stunts in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, and characters can freely take Stunts of this sort, while custom Stunts can be contrasted against these templates to guage balance.</p>
<h3 id="because-i-am-awesome-at...">Because I Am Awesome At...</h3>
<p>This pattern for this template is...</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear, or are otherwise awesome]</strong>, I get a +2 while I am <strong>[pick one: Carefully, Cleverly, Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily]</strong> <strong>[pick one: Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> and <strong>[pick one: attack, defend, create advantage or overcome]</strong> when <strong>[describe a circumstance]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skulker</strong>: Because I am so good at escaping notice, I get +2 while I am Sneakily Roguish and create advantage or overcome challenges to avoid notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Weapon Master</strong>: Because I am so skilled at fighting with <strong>[pick a weapon]</strong>, I gain +2 while I am Cleverly Combative when attacking with my weapon of choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Quick Strike</strong>: Because I am fast and accurate, I get +3 when I am Quickly Combative and attack an opponent that has not yet gone in this exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Bolts</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of Arcane Bolts, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Arcane and attack with ranged magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Careful Crossbowman</strong>: Because I am skilled with a crossbow, I gain +2 when I am Carefully Roguish and attack with a crossbow.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dungeoneer</strong>: Because I am a seasoned adventurer and dungeoneer, I gain +2 when I am Clever and create advantage or overcome when a item of common adventurer gear that I have proves to be useful.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="once-per-session-i-may...">Once Per Session I may...</h3>
<p>This pattern for this template is...</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear, or are otherwise awesome]</strong>, once per game session I can <strong>[describe something cool you can do]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Whirlwind Attack</strong>: Because I am a potent warrior <strong>once per session</strong> when I am Flashily Combative and attack with a suitable weapon, I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sudden Slumber</strong>: Because I have mastered a magical talent from olden times, once per session I can put any number of nameless mooks who lack consequence slots in my zone or an adjacent zone to sleep. I may affect additional contiguous zones by spending a Fate point per additional zone. To do this I must use Carefully Arcane to create the advantage <strong>Sleep Now My Pretties</strong> against an Average (+1) difficulty. Those affected will sleep artificially deeply, and resist being woken for the remainder of the scene; someone trying to wake a victim must overcome a difficulty equal to Average (+1) plus my margin of success.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Chained Lightning</strong>: Because I am able to project a bolt of lighting that jumps from target to target, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Abyssal Darkness</strong>: Because I have fiendish lineage, once per session as an action I have the ability to add the situational Aspect <strong>Abyssal Darkness</strong> to my zone or an adjacent zone. When I activate this ability I can choose to spread it to cover additional contiguous zones at the cost of one (1) Fate point per additional zone. This effect provides active Superb (+5) defense against notice attempts and targeted abilites. This Aspect lasts for an entire scene, though it can be overcome and removed by a character with Arcane, Divine, or Primal of +3 or higher opposed by a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I am unaffected by this Aspect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Trapsetter</strong>: Because I am skilled at setting traps, as a non-action I can spend a Fate point to create the situational Aspect <strong>Trapped!</strong> on my zone or up to three (3) zones away with two (2) invokes. The Aspect represents a trap I happened to have set up while no one was looking, or a clever exploitation of the ambient scenery. My traps can take many forms, limited only to things I can narratively justify. I can invoke the Aspect to hinder someone in the affected zone or to help myself or an ally acting against someone in the affected zone. The difficulty for others to notice my trap before the first time it is invoked or to overcome it is equal to my <strong>(Clever + Sneaky + Primal)</strong> traits if in a wildlands area, otherwise it is equal to my <strong>(Clever + Sneaky + Roguish)</strong> traits.</p>

<h2 id="because-i-am-extra-good...">Because I Am Extra Good...</h2>
<p>This Stunt template gives a flat +1 bonus for a specific combination of an Approach <strong>or</strong> Archetype with an action.</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are extra good at a specific Archetype or Approach]</strong>, I get a +1 when I am <strong>[pick one: Carefully, Cleverly, Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily, Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> and <strong>[pick one: attack, defend, create advantage or overcome]</strong>.</p>

<p>Narrative Variant:</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are extra good at a specific Archetype or Approach]</strong>, I get a +1 when I am <strong>[pick one: Carefully, Cleverly, Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily, Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> and <strong>[describe a narrative circumstance]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combat Veteran</strong>: Because I have engaged in so much combat, I gain +1 when I am Combative and attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bushwhacker</strong>: Because I am great at setting up ambushes, I gain +1 when I Sneakily set up an ambush or create a related advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Staves Are Just So Useful</strong>: Because I have learned to put my staff to good use, I gain +1 when I am Careful and narratively describe how my staff helps me. This can be used to aid me in my spell casting as well as to fend off pesky attackers, or whatever fits the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heavy Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear heavy armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am heavily armored.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Cloak Of Elvenkind</strong>: Because I have a magical Cloak of Elvenkind, I gain +1 when Sneaky to create advantage or overcome to avoid notice while wearing it.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="archetype-switch">Archetype Switch</h2>
<p>This Stunt template allows a character to use one of their Archetypes in place of another Archetype.</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are able to leverage a Archetype to do something that is usually accomplished with a different Archetype]</strong>, I may use <strong>[pick one: Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> instead of <strong>[pick a different one: Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> for <strong>[describe the function of the other Archetype that you can accomplish]</strong> when I <strong>[describe the circumstances where this Stunt applies]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heed Me!</strong>: Because I have a magical knack that allows me to augment my spoken voice with enchanting magics I may use Arcane for social interactions if I can talk and my target can hear me. I am resisted by Arcane when I do so. This is a form of mind-affecting magic. This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong>: Because I have mastered protecting myself with magic, I may use Arcane to defend against physical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>True Seeing</strong>: Because my patron diety grants me awareness, my powers of observation are divinely enhanced; I may use Divine instead of Focused to notice or perceive things, and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wilderness Warrior</strong>: Because I am so adept at stalking prey and hunting in the wilderness, I may use Primal instead of Combative to attack when I am in the wilderness.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Urban Jungle</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of fading away, blending in, and avoiding notice even in urban areas among people, I can use Primal instead of Roguish to create advantage and overcome when attempting to avoid being noticed in civilized areas (Primal is already usable for this in rural, wildland areas).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Town And Country Sneaker</strong>: Because I am so good at lurking and being stealthy, I can use Roguish instead of Primal to create advantage and overcome when attempting to avoid being noticed in rural and wildland areas (Roguish is already usable for this in civilized areas).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Duelist</strong>: Because I am skilled at the art of using weapons such as thinblades, foils, rapiers, epees, sabres, and stilettos (i.e, 'dueling' weapons), I am a surprisingly effective combatant when armed appropriately. Though my fighting style remains agile and even acrobatic at times, when armed with an appropriate weapon I can use Focused in place of Combatives in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dirty Infighter</strong>: Because I am skilled at dirty tricks fighting and getting inside my opponents' guard to strike at vulnerable areas, I am a surprisingly effective combatant. Though my fighting style remains unconventional and evasive, when armed with daggers, light one handed melee weapons such as short swords, garrottes, saps, makeshift weapons, and similar armaments I can use Roguish to directly engage opponents who are using Combative in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="bonus-archetype">Bonus Archetype</h2>
<p>This Stunt template allows a character to add one of their Archetypes to a resolution when they are using a different Archetype.</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are able to add a Archetype to do something using different Archetype]</strong>, while I am being <strong>[pick one: Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> I may add <strong>[pick one: Combative, Roguish, Focused, Arcane, Primal, Divine]</strong> as a bonus to <strong>[pick one: attack, defend, create advantage or overcome]</strong> when <strong>[describe a circumstance]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Favor</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against physical attacks, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Smite</strong>: Because I have been granted the ability to smite those who stand against me by my patron deity, I gain +1 while Combative to strike down a foe within my zone whose nature is anathemic to my patron deity; further if my attack inflicts a consequence I gain an additional free invoke on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wilderness Runner</strong>: Because I am so swift and able to run for hours, I may add my Primal capability bonus when I am Focused while running in wildlands.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combative Intimidation</strong>: Because I am heavily armed and obviously skilled at inflicting harm, I may add my Combative capability to create advantage or overcome when I attempt to intimidate or assert control over a social situation if I am armed appropriately.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="upgrade-a-boost">Upgrade A Boost</h2>
<p>This Stunt template allows a character to upgrade a boost gained for succeeding with style into a full Aspect or some other benefit.</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe why you are able to do this]</strong>, if I get a boost when I am <strong>[describe the circumstance when this Stunt applies]</strong> I may use it to create the situational Aspect <strong>[pick the name of the situational Aspect]</strong> on <strong>[pick the target (i.e. myself, the scene, the target)]</strong> with two (2) invokes.</p>
</div>
<p>Narrative Variant:</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe why you are able to do this]</strong>, if I get a boost when I am <strong>[describe the circumstance when this Stunt applies]</strong> I may use it to <strong>[describe the effect]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Defensive Posture</strong>: Because I am trained in a defensive fighting style, if I get a boost when I am Carefully Combative while attacking I may use it to create the situational Aspect <strong>Defensive Posture</strong> on myself with two (2) invokes.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Riposte</strong>: Because even my defense is dangerous, whenever I am Flashily Focused and defend with style against a physical melee attack while wielding a dueling weapon I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on my attacker, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Passing Strike</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quickly Combative and attack, if I choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move one (1) zone away, as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="powered-by-fate">Powered By Fate!</h2>
<p>This Stunt template allows a character to have an extra-powerful effect that requires a Fate point to activate or use.</p>
<p>As a variant, take one of the other Stunt templates and amp up the effect at the cost of a Fate point.</p>
<div class="template">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe why you are able to do this]</strong>, I can spend a Fate point to <strong>[describe the effect]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Windrider</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of riding the winds, I can spend a Fate point to fly for the duration of a scene and potentially longer. While flying I may move 1 additional zone per exchange and I ignore any ground based obstacles I can fly over. However, while I am flying in this fashion I must move at least 1 zone each exchange and I can't go backwards. If I can't move forward (in approx a 120 degree arc) I must land, ending the effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Reverberation</strong>: Because I know many Words of Power, if I am currently able to speak as a non-action I may spend a Fate point to utter a Word and immediately remove from play any one situational Aspect in my zone or an adjacent zone with a difficulty of Legendary (+8) or less to overcome. Though there is no 4dF roll involved, I am considered to be acting in a Flashily Arcane manner when I do this and the reverberations of the Word are very noticeable.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Disrupt Undead</strong>: When I am Forcefully Arcane and attack I may spend a Fate point to target all Undead in my zone and all adjacent zones without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="companions-constructs-and-special-items">Companions, Constructs, and Special Items</h2>
<p>A Fate Accelerated character can use a Stunt to &quot;unlock&quot; a mininion or secondary character profile. There are many different permutations of this, but the three most common scenarios are to have a persistent companion who travels with the character, or some kind of construct that can be temporarily brought into a scene, or special items that are more complicated than usual and call for a little extra grit to define.</p>
<h3 id="companions">Companions</h3>
<p>This Stunt template allows a character to have a companion, represented by a mook or minor NPC template. The player controls the companion generally, but the character can be compelled against using the companion's Aspects. Simple mook template companions cost a single Stunt slot, but multiple distinct companions cost additional Stunt slots.</p>
<p>More capable and durable companions with Consequences, or minor NPCs with Approaches, Archetypes, and Stunts can also be taken, but cost 2 or more Stunt slots as determined by the GM.</p>
<p>A lenient GM might allow a particular companion an extra +1 in their &quot;Good At&quot; set matched by an extra -1 in their &quot;Bad At&quot; set, or an extra stress box if some other part of the companion is trailing behind the power curve a bit with an eye towards the companion's overall potency, but any improvements beyond that should be reflected by an additional Stunt slot being allocated to the companion.</p>
<p>If a companion gets killed or removed from play for some reason, a character can swap out the Stunt at a milestone. A character can also swap the Stunt for an effectively <em>identical</em> Stunt and thus get a replacement companion with similar abilities, with some narrative support to explain it away. A companion Stunt that takes multiple Stunt slots takes 1 milestone per slot to replace in this fashion.</p>
<div class="description">

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>A variant of this allows a character to create (summon, call, conjure, whatever) a magical construct or similar effect that acts independently from the character to do some specific thing.</p>
<p>At your option, a single Stunt equivalent construct can have 5 simple stress like an extra tough Mook, or 2 stress boxes and a Mild Consequence like a weaker minor NPC.</p>
<p>However, to counterbalance this extra toughness, a construct must be limited in some significant way, such as being anchored in place, or limited to a specific purpose or action. If you want to make a &quot;construct&quot; that is more like a normal character, just treat it as a companion instead.</p>
<p>Like all companions, constructs can be made better and more durable by allocating more Stunt slots to them.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Servitor</strong>: Because I have a magical ability, <strong>[describe the circumstance that allows you to do this]</strong>, while I am <strong>[pick Approach + Archetype combination]</strong> I may attempt to overcome a Superb (+5) difficulty to summon a <strong>[describe the thing you summon]</strong> in my zone to serve a specific purpose.

</ul>

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="special-item">Special Item</h3>
<p>Another variant of this allows a character to have a special item with complex traits (something that would be an Extra in Fate Core, for instance). In this variant, the &quot;Good At&quot; abilities of the item apply as a bonus when the character uses the special item to do that thing, and the &quot;Bad At&quot; abilities of the special item apply as a penalty whenever relevant.</p>
<p>Instead of skill-like ability bonuses, a special item might have flat Stunt-like abilities, with negotiation with the GM to arrive at a fair tradeoff for such abilities.</p>
<p>Special items usually have a Mild Consequence and take stress like a character. More powerful special items might have even more Consequences, though this extra durability should be taken into account when assessing the Refresh equivalence of the Stunt.</p>
<p>Characters wielding a special item can choose to push stress onto their special item rather than take it themselves if it makes narrative sense, and if the special item is taken out it is either removed from play for at least a session or is broken and needs to be repaired or replaced as makes sense to the narrative (unique special items would eventually become usable again, while more generic special items can just be &quot;replaced&quot;).</p>
<div class="description">

<p>A number of specific Stunts are defined in the <a href="#simple-magic-options">Simple magic options</a> section to help model things like Prepared casting, Alchemy, Elementalism, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="custom-stunts">Custom Stunts</h2>
<p>Players don't have to use a Stunt template to make their Stunts; they are simply provided as a convenience. Though they require more discussion and balancing, custom Stunts offer one of the very best ways to differentiate a character and should be encouraged.</p>
<p>Some examples are provided, but really, Custom Stunts can take any form that the GM and players are comfortable with.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Better Lucky Than Good</strong>: Because I am unusually lucky, whenever I make a 4dF resolution roll and the result is [0 0 0 0] (all blanks) I treat the outcome as if I had rolled + + + + (all pluses)</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Aggressive Assault</strong>: Because I am driven to extreme aggression, when I am Forcefully Combative and attack I may add from one to four additional Fate dice to my 4dF attack roll and choose the four best dice as my result. However, until my next exchange whenever I defend I add the same number of Fate dice to my defend rolls and choose the four worst dice as my result.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sublime Expertise (-2)</strong>: Because I am extremely skilled and rarely blunder, whenever I make a 4dF roll I treat any result of less than 0 as -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bottomless Satchel</strong>: Because I have a magical Bottomless Satchel that is much bigger on the inside than on the outside, I can carry a large amount of supplies as long as each item can fit through the opening of the bag (which is about half a meter across at full expansion). I can Carefully overcome against a Fair (+2) difficulty to retrieve anything I've explicitly put into it; failure just means I have to keep rooting around looking for the item with additional actions. With the GM's permission I can also spend a Fate point to pull out a mundane item that can fit through the opening of the satchel that I haven't explictly put in but 'happen to have'.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Globe Of Invulnerability</strong>: Because I have mastered a potent magical discipline, when I am Carefully Arcane I can <strong>spend a Fate point</strong> to allow create an advantage to add the situational Aspect <strong>Globe Of Invulnerability</strong> with two (2) invokes to myself for the remainder of the scene (and perhaps longer). I can add more invokes to this Aspect by being Carefully Arcane and creating an advantage against a difficulty of Great (+4). While this Aspect is available I can invoke it to use Carefully Arcane to defend against any kind of attack affecting me or the area immediately around me (including any allies). This Aspect can be overcome and removed by a character with Arcane, Divine, or Primal of +4 or higher opposed by a Legendary (+8) difficulty. This stunt requires Arcane +4 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Born Of Flame and Darkness</strong>: Because I have fiendish lineage, when I am Flashily Focused I am able to project searing flames from my body as an attack at targets within my zone or in an adjacent zone; these attacks are considered to be Arcane. Additionally I can justify create advantage, overcome, and defend actions when fire, heat, darkness, or demons are involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fueled By Suffering</strong>: Because I channel my pain and suffering and become more dangerous when I am in danger, when I take stress or consequences from attacks I gain a Boost called <strong>Fueled By Suffering</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sudden Attack</strong>: Because I am prone to sudden violence, I get +2 when I Forcefully attack an opponent who is unaware of my intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Damage Reduction</strong>: Because I am more durable than normal, I reduce by one (1) all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Reduction</strong>: Because I am significantly more rugged, robust, and survivable due to my deep connection with primal forces, I reduce by one (1) all physical stress inflicted on me, and I reduce by two (2) all environmental stress inflicted on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Extra Damaging</strong>: Because I am <strong>[describe why you can cause more damage than normal]</strong>, when I succesfully attack while <strong>[describe a specific circumstance where this Stunt applies]</strong> I inflict +2 shifts of extra damage.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="starting-power-level-options">Starting Power Level Options</h1>
<p>This section provides options to help a GM decide how powerful they want starting characters to be for a given Pathfinder Fate Accelerated campaign.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated assumes that starting characters are created using the <a href="#character-creation">Character Creation</a> guidelines.</p>
<p>The starting character with [3] Refresh, [+2, +1, +1] in Approaches, a total of [+4] in Archetypes, and [3] free Stunt slots described therein is considered to be a &quot;baseline&quot; character; all of the full character write-ups provided in this material measure how many advancements they have above or below that baseline.</p>
<p>However, kicking off a given Pathfinder Fate Accelerated campaign with starting characters that are more or less powerful than the guidelines assume is not a problem. The following options are provided to assist with this.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-high-level-characters">Simulating High Level Characters</h2>
<p>Starting characters are assumed to be roughly equivalent to 5th-6th level Pathfinder characters. However, it is easy enough to simulate higher leveled Pathfinder characters by the simple expedient of adding advancements.</p>
<h3 id="approximated-advancement-chart">Approximated Advancement Chart</h3>
<p>The below chart provides an approximated advancement progression.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that this <strong>is not</strong> a &quot;level up&quot; table, nor is it intended to dictate to GM's how fast or slow they progress characters in their campaigns. GM's are free to use it as such if they want to, but it is not intended to measure the progress of player characters that are adventuring and advancing via actual play.</p>
<p>The chart is only offered as an aid for making new characters that start out more powerful than the default assumptions.</p>
<p>To start a campaign off with more powerful characters, the GM should just pick a level of play such as &quot;Epic&quot; or &quot;Wondrous&quot; and then consult the corresponding row in the chart for the total Archetype and Approach bonuses, Stunt slots, Aspects, and Refresh base for that power level.</p>
<p>Players then use that information as their guide when making their characters.</p>

<h4 id="fate-ladder-label">Fate Ladder Label</h4>
<p>As a reference aid, the advancement chart equates a character's total Archetype bonuses (shown in the left most column) with the corresponding label from the Fate Ladder.</p>
<p>Thus if you took a character like <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Dwyth/Epic/Dwyth.aspx">this version of Dwyth</a> and added up all of their Archetype bonuses to get a +7, you see that you have an &quot;Epic&quot; character on your hands, while <a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Eleo/Mythic/Eleo.aspx">this version of Eleo</a> has Archetypes that add up to +11, and can thus be said to be a &quot;Mythic&quot; character.</p>
<p>GM's that find no value in such labeling are free to ignore it.</p>

<h3 id="extra-stunt-at-higher-rungs">Extra Stunt At Higher Rungs</h3>
<p>Careful reading of the chart will reveal that it grants an extra free Stunt slot at the very highest rungs. This allows truly powerful characters to pick up a signature ability at the apex of their progression a little more easily.</p>
<p>The extra free slot is counted against the advancement total.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="beware-assumptions-have-been-made">Beware: Assumptions Have Been Made</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of milestones, it isn't really possible to know how many significant milestones a character will have before reaching a major milestone during actual play; that is a function of the adventure plotting and the GM's discretion. But as Refresh and Archetype bonuses are tied to major milestones, this makes it difficult to predict with any certainty exactly what a real character will look like as they progress during actual play.</p>
<p>Thus for the sake of expedience the chart makes the assumption of two significant milestones per major milestone. This is probably a conservative estimate overall for most groups, but it provides an easy rule of thumb and is good enough for purposes of starting characters off at a higher power level.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="extra-aspects-at-higher-rungs">Extra Aspects At Higher Rungs</h3>
<p>The chart also allows for extra Aspect slots at higher rungs on the ladder, but they are not included in the advancement total. It can be helpful to have some space to fully describe truly powerful characters more thoroughly rather than try to shoehorn it all into three Aspects. They are offered as a convenience, and are not mandatory.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-1st-level-characters">Simulating &quot;1st Level&quot; Characters</h2>
<p>Aside from where noted, it is assumed that the standard Fate Accelerated guidelines on starting characters (3 Refresh, 3 Aspects, 3 Stunts, Approaches and Archetypes as indicated) are in effect. Consequently, starting Fate Accelerated characters are considerably more capable and powerful than starting chracters in the source material (Pathfinder FAE starting characters are roughly equivalent to 5th-6th level Pathfinder characters).</p>
<p>This isn't a bad thing; Fate Accelerated starting characters are supposed to be capable and bad ass. They can engage with more and bigger adventures faster, and not &quot;waste&quot; early play sessions dealing with minor things simply to &quot;level up&quot; to a state where more significant things are possible.</p>
<p>However if a particular group wants to more closely mimic the &quot;level progression&quot; of the source material and have starting characters be more analogous to &quot;1st level characters&quot;, consider the following option.</p>
<p>&quot;1st level&quot; equivalent characters define one Stunt and one or two Aspects when starting play, and fill in the rest over the course of play or during milestones. Additionally, characters may have either one (1) Approach at +2 or two (2) Approaches at +1 each, and they only have two (2) points to allocate to their Archetypes instead of four (4) points.</p>
<p>For reference, the <a href="#approximated-advancement-chart">Approximated Advancement Chart</a> includes this rung of ability.</p>
<p>Using this option it takes a couple of major milestones to &quot;catch up&quot; to a normal starting Pathfinder Fate Accelerated character, and more closely mimics the extreme early ramping of character abilities in the source material.</p>
<h1 id="mook-options">Mook Options</h1>
<p>Mooks are the minor, often nameless, opposition encountered in Fate Accelerated. The main differences between a mook and a normal character is that a mook has a simplified write-up, and can represent either an individual or a &quot;mob&quot; that acts as a group.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>A broad selection of mook write-ups for antagonists are available in the <a href="#sample-bestiary">Sample Bestiary</a>, while mook write-ups for adventuring encounters and challenges such as traps appear in various <a href="#sample-adventures">Sample Adventures</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Mooks aren't always people or monsters; inanimate objects and situations such as complex traps or environmental considerations like burning lava or a pit of acid can also be represented using a mook write-up. This allows for a more detailed encounter than narrative or aspects alone and is particularly appropriate in situations where stress might be inflicted as part of an encounter with the object or situation.</p>
<p>Using the Fate Accelerated rules starting on page 38 of the rulebook, very simple guidelines are given for mooks which can be summarized as &quot;one or two aspects, a list of things they get +2 to do, another list of things they get -2 to do, a stress track of 0-2 boxes, and no consequences&quot;. Mention is given to using more complex options from Fate Core if desired, and that's mooks as written.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated expands on mook write-ups considerably to allow more variability, which offers more options when translating source material from Pathfinder into Fate Accelerated terms.</p>
<h2 id="baseline-mook">Baseline Mook</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated baseline mooks are essentially the same as mooks as described in the Fate Accelerated rulebook. The main difference is that they can be upgraded, and instead of having a list of things that get a bonus or penalty, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated assigns a bonus or a penalty to a specific skill-like ability or concept, which allows a more finely grained allocation.</p>
<p>A baseline Mook gets two Aspects, uses a simple hit box track starting at zero (0) hit boxes, has one (1) skill-like ability that they are good at (+2) or two (2) skill-like abilities they are fair at (+1 each), and are either bad at one (1) thing (-2) or poor at two (2) things (-1 each).</p>
<h2 id="mook-autonomy-and-initiative">Mook Autonomy and Initiative</h2>
<p>Mooks act on their own, but unless they have a skill-like ability, Aspect, or Stunt that suggests otherwise, they have initiative 0.</p>
<h2 id="mook-threat-and-summoning-difficulty">Mook Threat and Summoning Difficulty</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows mooks to be upgraded, which increases the threat a given mook poses. As a convenience, the total upgrade value of a mook can be used as a comparative threat value. For instance, a mook with upgrades that total to +3 can be referred to as a +3 threat.</p>
<p>As a baseline mook has no upgrades, a baseline mook is effectively a +0 threat.</p>
<p>Finally, as described in the <a href="#conjuration-and-summoning">Conjuration And Summoning</a> section, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows mooks to be summoned when that makes sense to the story; the difficulty to summon a given mook is equal to the mook's threat level. For instance, an upgraded mook with upgrades totalling to +8 threat also presents a Legendary (+8) challenge for a summoner to overcome if attempting to summon that kind of mook.</p>

<h4 id="mook-stunts">Mook Stunts</h4>
<p>A mook can have one or more Stunts or similar Refresh reducing abilities. As mooks do not have Refresh, this is treated like any other mook upgrade. Simple Stunts that just grant a bonus to do something specific are already covered by the &quot;Good At&quot; feature of mooks; thus this option is better used for more complicated abilities that do something other than just grant bonuses.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-mook">Spellcasting Mook</h4>
<p>A mook can be a spellcaster, but must have a relevant skill-like ability at +3 or better. For instance, a goblin &quot;fire shaman&quot; might be &quot;Good At: Fire Magic (+3)&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="hit-boxes">Hit Boxes</h4>
<p>By default, the baseline mook has zero (0) hit boxes; however it can be upgraded to have more.</p>
<p>Unlike a Fate Accelerated mook who can only have up to two (2) stress boxes, <strong>there isn't an arbitrary cap on how many hit boxes a mook might have</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike stress boxes hit boxes explicitly are for absorbing stress that represents damage, each box always has a value of &quot;1&quot;, and additional damage inflicted rolls over to additional hit boxes.</p>
<p>Thus if a mook with five (5) hit boxes were struck by an attack that inflicted three (3) stress, three (3) hit boxes would be marked off.</p>
<p>When a mook takes more stress from damage than they have hit boxes, the mook is defeated. This might mean death, it might mean the mook runs away or otherwise exits the scene.</p>
<p>In Fate Accelerated some causes of stress are not characterized as damage; for instance social stress might take the form of loss of influence or standing in an argument. It is left to GM's discretion on a case by case basis to determine if a given mook loses hit boxes to a source of stress or not, and to interpret the narrative effect or lack thereof.</p>
<p>For instance, a crazed goblin mook might be unaffected by a hero's clever repartee or the emotional angst of a tragic turn of events but might treat an attack on their morale by an angry canine animal companion as damage, because goblins are terrified by dogs in the setting of Golarion and therefore might break and run when faced with such a threat. As always in Fate games, what makes sense to the evolving story is the correct line of play.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="hit-boxes-and-mobs">Hit Boxes And Mobs</h4>
<p>Hit boxes are very easy to use, particularly when used for &quot;mobs&quot;, i.e. groups of nameless minions that are meant to be defeated en masse.</p>
<p>When used in this way, it is typical for the number of members in the mob to be factored over the number of hit boxes for purposes of determining how many individuals are part of the mob.</p>
<p>For instance if a mob had ten (10) hit boxes and ten (10) members, each hit box would be assumed to be equivalent to one (1) member and thus losing three (3) hit boxes would be assumed to be equivalent to losing three (3) members from the mob.</p>
<p>On the other hand if a mob had ten (10) hit boxes and five (5) members, every two (2) hit boxes would be assumed to be equivalent to one (1) member and thus losing three (3) hit boxes would be assumed to be equivalent to losing one (1) member of the mob and injuring one (1) additional member of the mob.</p>
<p>However there is no requirement to track a close correlation between hit boxes and members in a mob if a given GM finds no value in the proposition; it is merely a convention.</p>
<h6 id="versus-zone-attacks">Versus Zone attacks</h6>
<p>Mathematically, it often makes sense to treat the members of a mob as individuals for purposes of absorbing damage from Zone attacks that do not split their shifts between targets.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="stress-boxes">Stress Boxes</h4>
<p>A mook can have stress boxes instead of hit boxes if desired, but as the upgrade chart indicates this is considered to be a more significant upgrade as it makes a mook more durable than an equivalent number of hit boxes. Each additional stress box increases the difficulty to summon the mook by +1. The stress boxes follow the normal progression of <strong>[1][2][3]</strong>, must be taken in order, and are capped at [3].</p>
<h4 id="consequences-1">Consequences</h4>
<p>In Pathfinder Fate Accelerated a mook that has a full stress track ( <strong>[1][2][3]</strong>) can have one or more consequences. Having consequences obviously makes a mook more durable, and should be reserved for more creditable threats such as mooks who are intended to have an impact upon a scene or present a more significant encounter.</p>
<p>Generally (though not always) mooks that have one or more consequences are treated as individuals and are more likely to be named.</p>
<h4 id="hindrances-1">Hindrances</h4>
<p>Mooks can have additional &quot;Bad At&quot; penalties at the GM's discretion, and typically used to help balance a mook out. It also lowers the threat level and thus the summoning difficulty of a mook.</p>
<p>Mooks can also have various restrictions that are not defined as a penalty. Many such things can be reflected in a mooks aspects, but a GM looking for a little more mechanical grit can further describe the mook and assess how much the restriction lowers the mook's threat at their discretion.</p>
<p>As an example, if a mook happens to be immobile it would generally be implicit to their nature, as reflected by one or more Aspects.</p>
<p>For instance, a lock written up as a mook is attached to something and inanimate; there probably isn't any need to further define a restriction on the lock's mobility, and the lack of mobility doesn't really impact the challenge the lock's write-up represents, which is getting to whatever is behind the lock.</p>
<p>But in other cases immobility may not be so intrinsic to a mook's concept, and more importantly does reduce the challenge represented by the mook; in such a case it may make sense to explicitly note the restriction.</p>
<p>Morale is another area where a specific restriction might apply and is often worth calling out explicitly. If there are circumstances under which a mook will always run away or withdraw from a conflict or otherwise concede without putting up much resistance, they are not really as big of a challenge as their write-up suggests and adding a restriction that recognizes this often makes sense.</p>
<h4 id="reducing-bad-at-penalties">Reducing Bad At Penalties</h4>
<p>Mooks can reduce the default &quot;Bad At&quot; penalty the baseline begins with as an upgrade. Each -1 removed also raises the threat level and thus the summoning difficulty of a mook by +1.</p>
<h4 id="mob-dependent-upgrades">Mob-dependent Upgrades</h4>
<p>A mook write-up might be presented with a note describing additional upgrades that are turned on only when the mook is treated as a mob of a certain size.</p>
<p>For instance, Excited Goblins are pretty weak when encountered individually, but the write-up says to <em>&quot;Treat up to ten (10) Excited Goblins as a mob; add +1 hit box and +1 to attack for every two Excited Goblins remaining&quot;</em>. Thus if a mob of Excited Goblins had six (6) members, compared to the baseline write-up the mob would gain +3 hit boxes and +3 when attacking. Losing a hit box would reduce the mob to four (4) members and the mob would gain a +2 bonus when attacking instead of a +3 bonus.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="negative-aspects">Negative Aspects</h4>
<p>As an alternative, one or more Aspects that are primarily negative, which is to say mostly penalize or disadvantage a mook, may reasonably be considered to be hindrances rather than upgrades. If doing this, care should be taken to make sure the negative intentions of such Aspects are clearly suggested or communicated.</p>
<h5 id="situational-to-a-summon">Situational To A Summon</h5>
<p>Hindrances particular to a given circumstance might also be added to an existing write-up by the player of a spellcaster in an attempt to lower the summoning difficulty of the mook to improve their character's odds of success.</p>
<p>This is fine, as long as the hindrances are legitimately applied and not just an attempt at min-maxing.</p>

<h1 id="money-options">Money Options</h1>
<p>This section collects various options to help a GM decide how they want to handle money in their Pathfinder Fate Accelerated campaign.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't concern itself about the economy in the game setting a GM is using, or defining &quot;starting funds&quot;, or even tracking money by default.</p>
<p>From a character definition perspective, wealth or a significant lack of it should be reflected in a character's High Concept and / or Aspects, and that is sufficient.</p>
<p>Unless the GM objects, gear can just be written out narratively as trappings without worrying about associated monetary considerations.</p>
<p>A thing that occurs in the source material is that high level adventurers often accumulate absurd levels of wealth, which then gets funnelled into purchasing encroachingly more powerful magical items to make them even more capable so that they can go out and accumulate even more loot in an ascending cycle of power creep. It causes the rules to feel it necessary as a matter of <em>game balance</em>  to detail precise breakdowns on how much wealth is appropriate for characters of each level. It causes the already lengthy process of stating up a high level NPC to take even longer as appropriate magic items must be purchased, closely following the wealth per level guidelines.</p>
<p>Thus as adventurers succeed (i.e. survive to reach higher character levels), accumulation of wealth and &quot;getting enough&quot; to &quot;stay competitive&quot; with the game's expectations actually <em>increases</em>  in importance rather than decreases. And as characters accumulate more magical loot, they eventually become more defined by what magic items they carry than their own intrinsic qualities.</p>
<p>However, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't care about loot. It only cares about interesting characters and telling a good collaborative story with them. Thus, the only value tracking money or managing an economy has by default is the extent to which such things help tell a more interesting story, and as soon as such things are no longer helping to drive the story they are just getting in the way.</p>
<p>Therefore, by default, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't do anything fancy to track money. How much stuff player characters are currently dragging around is assumed to be enslaved to the needs of the plot and to be subject to change as the story evolves.</p>
<p>So, whether one character starts off wealthy and another starts off poor is not really that big of a deal in the scheme of things. The rich character can lose it all to a twist of plot, while the pauper character might stumble into wealth if that's the way the narrative develops...it's all grist for the story mill. Ultimately, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated is a narrative game, so &quot;whatever serves the story&quot; is the primary focus.</p>
<p>But different GM's will vary on how best to serve the story, and some GM's may worry about &quot;game balance&quot; and the desire to make &quot;better gear&quot; &quot;cost more&quot;. Thus, individual groups are free to handle it however they like and the below options are offered up with commentary on why a GM might choose one of them.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't intended to be comprehensive; it just hits the most obvious options.</p>
<h2 id="old-school-loot-tracking">Old School Loot Tracking</h2>
<p>Many GM's might prefer to maintain an in-game economy with price lists for goods and services, such as is done in D&amp;D and many other games. In such a model 10 gp is just 10 gp and characters simply keep a running tally on their character sheet or a scrap of paper of their loot, old school style. When more money is acquired the number is bumped up, when it is spent the number is bumped down.</p>
<p>It should be fairly safe to assume that most gamers know how this works and laborious details or an explanation of basic addition and subtraction are not required here.</p>
<p>One of the pros of this approach is familiarity, and being able to use existing price charts from the source material. It is concrete and easy to reason about. It gives GM's a stick and carrot to motivate characters with; being out of money is a powerful motivator for going out to get more, and the promise of a big payoff is often sufficient to &quot;hook&quot; characters lacking any other motivation into a particular adventure. If the characters are kept poor, the concreteness of this method can also contribute to an overall &quot;gritty&quot; tone, which can help a GM tell a particular kind of story.</p>
<p>The main con of this approach is that it can be a giant pain in the rear end, adding a tedious layer of bookkeeping both during play (tracking the numbers) and in between sessions for the GM (keeping players honest and character sheets up to date, detailing the contents of opponents' purses during adventure design).</p>
<p>Another con is that the concreteness of the economy and personal loot and gear will generally bleed into other areas of a character, and as Fate Accelerated characters are fairly abstract this is usually an awkward and undesirable development. For instance if a character has a Stunt defined as a &quot;magic sword&quot; that just grants a +1 to attack in a game where old school money tracking is being used questions like how much is the sword worth, can it be bought and sold, etc will naturally creep up...but really the &quot;magic sword&quot; is just supposed to be part of the character's concept and not a commodity.</p>
<p>Lastly and perhaps most damningly, it can also bog the game down in accumulation of loot to the detriment of story.</p>
<h2 id="situational-aspects">Situational Aspects</h2>
<p>Some groups may not want to deal in the tracking of filthy lucre and prefer to lean on Fate's excellent Aspect model to deal with it. In this method money is handled as situational Aspects with some number of invokes on them (<strong>Big Score! (2)</strong>, <strong>Beer Money (5)</strong>, <strong>Bag of small loose gems (3)</strong>). Such Aspects can be attached to characters, a scene or a location, the adventuring party itself, or whatever makes sense.</p>
<p>The main pro to this method is it is nicely simple and abstract and doesn't get in the way of the story; indeed Aspects help tell a story and often rise directly from emergent play. Another pro is that it encourages players to not get bogged down in numbers and loot accumulation. It also simplifies encounter design for the GM as they don't have to put on their accountant's visor and pull out the old abacus to determine how much money is appropriate to be in every lizardman's lair or dragon's horde.</p>
<p>The main con of this method is that due to its abstraction, basic monetary transactions that would normally be mere addition and subtraction require adjudication; for instance what is the conversion rate when a player wants to &quot;break&quot; an invoke on their <strong>My Share Of The Dragon's Horde</strong> situational Aspect into some number of invokes on a <strong>Basic Living Expenses</strong> situational Aspect? Another con is that tracking of situational Aspects is just another kind of bookkeeping; less concrete than tracking individual coinage and thus less bothersome, but bookkeeping nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="wealth-stress">Wealth Stress</h2>
<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-system-toolkit/">Fate System Toolkit</a> describes a means of handling wealth using a Wealth stress track, detailed on page 69.</p>
<p>This method is similar to using the Situational Aspect option; they have similar levels of abstraction and the same basic pros and cons. However this method grants characters with wealth-related Aspects extra stress boxes on their Wealth stress track. Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't normally attach weight to Aspects in this way, and doing so incentivizes players to take Aspects for metagame reasons rather than character concept reasons. Whether this feature of a Wealth stress track is a pro or a con is left to individual GM's to decide, and the basic mechanism could still be used with a slight tweak of course.</p>
<h2 id="narrative-based-gm-fiat">Narrative-based GM Fiat</h2>
<p>A GM willing to adjudicate on the fly if characters have enough money or resources to do something or not can go &quot;no-system&quot;. The GM just makes decisions based upon the context of what has occurred previously and what is happening currently in the story. When the GM feels that the characters have sufficient resources to do whatever they are attempting, they allow success or success at a cost. When the GM feels that the characters have insufficient resources or need to do something specific to justify moving the story forward, they simply state that to be the case and the story proceeds accordingly.</p>
<p>Using this method, the GM should be fair and indicate to the players when their characters are running low on resources. Of course even lack of resources can be turned into a positive thing by weaving it into the emerging story, using it as a hook or a goad, even tying it into consequences or compels on appropriate Aspects if lack of resources is appropriate and relevant.</p>
<p>A pro of this approach is that it is purely based on character concept and narrative. For GM's comfortable with this style, it is incredibly empowering, and gives the GM yet one more tool to help develop the emerging story. There's also no bookkeeping beyond any notes a forgetful GM might want to jot down to jar their memory.</p>
<p>The main con of this approach is that many people, GM's and players alike, are not comfortable with this level of &quot;hand wavium&quot; abstraction. Some people want hard numbers and are frustrated by the lack of them. Some GM's are not willing or able to make the many snap decisions this sort of method requires, or to be consistent enough to make it work.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-option-scaled-to-power-level">Hybrid Option: Scaled To Power Level</h2>
<p>A GM might consider the power scale of their campaign and adjust how they handle money and economy as the player characters advance. Funds or lack of funds can be a powerful story element for starting adventurers, and thus using a more gritty or exacting means of tracking resources can help establish a particular feel for lower powered characters. But at a certain point, powerful adventurers rise above all that and resources or lack there of are no longer a compelling story element.</p>
<p>Put into context, do we need to know how many copper pieces <strong>Fizzbane The Apexmage, Archonix of the Fell Mountains, Spell-laird of the Far Reaches, Pact-holder of Ten Thousand Demons</strong> has in his belt pouch? Is that really a matter of interest? Does it further the story? Is a scene where such a character has to grope through his belt pouches to come up with a few bits to buy an apple from a street vendor going to be a thing? Maybe in a farse or satire, but typically not in a high level adventuring campaign.</p>
<p>A GM might therefore start off using old school loot tracking or situational aspects or a wealth track or some other structured method, but at some point switch to a unstructured method such as narrative GM-fiat when it no longer really matters to the story how much money player characters have.</p>
<h1 id="initiative-options">Initiative Options</h1>
<p>This section collects various options to help a GM decide how they want to handle initiative in their Pathfinder Fate Accelerated campaign.</p>
<p>Initiative has become something of a hot topic in recent years, with some gamers not caring and others having very strong preferences or opinions on the matter. But either type of gamer can rest easy, as Pathfinder FAE is agnostic to initiative. A given group can use whatever initiative mechanism they want. However, a few options are specifically called out below.</p>
<h2 id="default-quickness">Default Quickness</h2>
<p>Just using the Fate Accelerated default option of basing initiative on the Quick Approach can be used as is.</p>
<h2 id="narrative-driven">Narrative Driven</h2>
<p>In this option who goes in what order is determined by the events in play in a given scene. In other words, what makes the most sense in the current scene, or what provides the most drama. If it is unclear, the GM decides who goes in what order. If an order is chosen but a player really wants their character to go first, they can spend a Fate point to do so.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb for using this sort of initiative is to consider how interesting or impactful it might be for a given character to go next. Aspects are a good guide for this, as is emerging play. In the case where two or more characters going next would be equivalently interesting, have them go simultaneously and see if that makes things even more interesting.</p>
<h2 id="approach-driven">Approach Driven</h2>
<p>Using this option initiative is decided by which Approach a given character wants to use for their action, following a progression.</p>
<p>When initiative starts to matter to the story the GM picks a relevant Approach such as Quick and says something along the lines of &quot;Who is acting quickly?&quot;. Any characters or NPC's using Quick to resolve their actions then go in bonus order; any ties are considered to occur simultaneously. The GM then says &quot;Who is acting cleverly?&quot;, and repeats the process.</p>
<p>The following progression is given as a default as in a physical combat the progression is assumed to start at Quick, but this could change based upon the situation. In an ambush or stealthy scenario the progression could be started at Sneaky, then flow to Careful, then to Quick, and so on. In an academic encounter it might start at Clever. Whatever makes sense in the situation.</p>
<div class="template">
<p><strong>Quick -&gt; Clever -&gt; Forceful -&gt; Flashy -&gt; Sneaky -&gt; Careful</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Using this method Mooks that lack a relevant skill-like ability or Approach generally go last, unless the GM chooses to treat a particular Mook as acting a certain way as fits the scene.</p>
<h2 id="chart-driven">Chart Driven</h2>
<p>Using this option the GM maintains an initiative chart starting at 0 and going up to 10 or higher. At the begining of each exchange in a conflict, each player places a token representing their character on the chart on the number equal to their Quickness plus any relevant Stunts. The GM does the same for NPCs. A player can invoke a relevant Aspect to gain a +2 bonus and move their token up accordingly.</p>
<p>The GM then starts counting down from the top of the chart.</p>
<p>When the first token is encountered, if it is a player character's token that player may take their character's action, <strong>or choose to allow any other player character who has not yet gone in the exchange to take their action</strong>.</p>
<p>If a GM's token is encountered, the GM may take an action for any NPC that has not yet gone in the exchange. If both a player character and a GM token are encountered, the player character token is resolved first.</p>
<p>A player may choose to use their character's action for the turn to create advantage against an Average (+1) difficulty to attach the situational Aspect <strong>Improved Initiative</strong> on themselves. They may use invokes on this Aspect in following exchanges to boost their initiative in those exchanges.</p>
<h2 id="baton-pass">Baton Pass</h2>
<p>Use a prop of some sort to indicate initiative; which we will refer to as the baton.</p>
<p>When a scene starts, if a player character is driving the action or initiating a conflict, that character's player gets the baton. If the GM is springing an ambush or otherwise forcing a conflict on the player characters the GM gets the baton.</p>
<p>In any given scene, whoever currently has the baton chooses a player character that has not gone yet in the exchange to go next (they may choose their own character), <em>or</em> allows the GM to take an action for a GM controlled character.</p>
<p>If a player character is chosen to go next, the baton is passed to the GM. If the GM is chosen to go next the GM passes the baton to a player of their choice whose character has not gone yet.</p>
<p>At any time if a player whose character has not gone yet or the GM wants the baton, they may pay a Fate point to the person who currently has the baton to take it. Note that Fate points paid by players to take the baton away from the GM go to the GM's pool of Fate points.</p>
<h1 id="milestones-advancement-options">Milestones &amp; Advancement Options</h1>
<p>This section collects various options to help a GM decide how they want to handle milestones and advancement in their Pathfinder Fate Accelerated campaign.</p>
<p>The default milestone based advancement described in Fate Accelerated works wonderfully and allows characters to not just get better but also to adapt to the unfolding story. Generally speaking, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated assumes that it is being used as described below. However, some GM's may prefer to do away with it entirely, or apply some restrictions to it and some options to help with that are provided.</p>
<h2 id="assumed-milestones-and-advancement">Assumed Milestones and Advancement</h2>
<p>Approaches cannot be raised above Superb (+5), as is normal for Fate Accelerated. Archetypes on the other hand are not capped and can be raised as high as a character is able to progress.</p>
<p>At <strong>minor milestones</strong>, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't change anything; just use the rules as written in the Fate Accelerated rulebook.</p>
<p>At <strong>significant milestones</strong>, again nothing is changed. You may raise an Approach by +1, as normal. You may not raise a Archetype by +1.</p>
<p>At <strong>major milestones</strong> in addition to the various things you are already allowed to do, in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated you may also raise <em>either</em> an Approach <em>or</em> a Archetype by +1, your choice.</p>
<p>Unlike Approaches you generally cannot switch your Archetypes around after play starts. A GM might allow you to take a +1 off of a Archetype and put it on a different Archetype during a milestone if you can make a strong enough case for it, but this should be an uncommon occurrence...perhaps in conjunction with a change of High Concept.</p>
<h2 id="mind-the-gap">Mind the Gap</h2>
<div class="tip">
<p>This option is only applicable to Approaches; it does not apply to Capabilites.</p>
</div>
<p>Using the standard advancement options described in the Fate Accelerated rulebook is generally a safe proposition, but there is nothing by default preventing a player for putting all of their Approach advancements into one Approach (up to the cap of +5). Some GM's may prefer to prevent characters from becoming imbalanced due to this sort of overconcentration of bonuses onto a single Approach; this option offers a fairly light handed way to do that.</p>
<p>Pathfinder FAE does not force a pyramid style of Approach advancement by default, but to prevent completely unbalanced characters GM's might consider enforcing some restrictions to prevent a player from putting all of their +1's in a single Approach and then attempting to resolve every challenge using that Approach.</p>
<p>For instance, Pathfinder FAE characters start with +2, +1, +1 in Approaches of their choice. Often a player raises the +2 bonus to a +3 at the first significant milestone to reenforce the character's specialty, and that's fine. But if the second significant milestone's raise goes to advance +3 to +4, we end up with a rather awkward character that has Approaches of +4, +1, +1; the third milestone often further tilts the character to +5, +1, +1.</p>
<p>One strategy to address this sort of outcome is a modified skill pyramid scheme referred to as <strong>Mind the Gap</strong>, which requires that +1 raises to Approaches gained at milestones be allocated to fill in or close any gaps between bonus numbers.</p>
<p>The following Approach distributions are provided as examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>+2, +1, +1
<ul>
<li>there is no gap; the character can advance any Approach by +1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>+3, +1, +1
<ul>
<li>the gap is between +1 and +3; the character needs a +2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>+4, +3, +1
<ul>
<li>the gap is between +1 and +3; the character needs a +2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>+3, +2, +1
<ul>
<li>there is no gap; the character can advance any Approach by +1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>+3, +2, +2
<ul>
<li>the gap is between +0 and +2; the character needs a +1 in a new Approach</li>
</ul></li>
<li>+4, +3, +2, +1
<ul>
<li>there is no gap; the character can advance any Approach by +1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for some early ramping up but gradually puts the breaks on as bonuses climb higher up the ladder.</p>
<p>The pattern extrapolates from there. The overall effect is, players can still specialize their characters and get that early extra +1 on their dominant Approach, but it prevents characters from getting competely lopsided.</p>
<h2 id="plot-driven-advancement">Plot Driven Advancement</h2>
<p>A GM might decide to ignore the milestone based advancement of Fate Accelerated and instead simply allow characters to improve and change as the plot demands. This might even happen mid-adventure.</p>
<p>The extent of improvements or changes is essentially a ruling by the GM or a negotiation between the GM and the player on a case by case basis. Maintaining &quot;balance&quot;, keeping things fair, and all other social contract considerations are left to the GM and their play group to sort out, with no schedule or expectation put forth by the game system.</p>
<p>The main pro of this option is that it is completely fluid and encourages full contact non-gamist narrative play. It can be particularly advantageous for high-end reality bending campaigns where the nature of a &quot;character&quot; is not necessarily static. In the context of a D &amp; D flavored game, it supports the style of play where the party &quot;levels up&quot; at specific pre-determined times to &quot;keep them on track&quot; for a long adventure arc.</p>
<p>The main con of this option is that it can be completely arbitrary and has the potential to marginalize player agency if the GM isn't careful. On the other hand if the GM is too permissive or powers up the characters too much it can turn into a &quot;Monty Haul&quot; sort of campaign. Another con is that some, perhaps even many, players enjoy looking forward to an advancement progression and it helps fuel their continuing enjoyment of playing their character; getting rid of a predictable progression can erode their interest in continued play.</p>
<h1 id="pathfinder-class-translations">Pathfinder Class Translations</h1>
<p>The following sections provide suggestions for translating various Pathfinder Classes into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated terms.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-alchemist">The Alchemist</a></strong>: these crafty chemists make a bewildering array of alchemical concoctions and devices. The alchemist captures their own magic potential within liquids and extracts they create, infusing their chemicals with virulent power to grant impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-barbarian">The Barbarian</a>:</strong> these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-bard">The Bard</a></strong>: masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-cavalier">The Cavalier</a></strong>: the cavalier is a brave warrior sworn to a code of honor, using wit, charm, and strength at arms to rally their companions and achieve their goals.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-cleric">The Cleric</a></strong>: devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-druid">The Druid</a></strong>: allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-fighter">The Fighter</a></strong>: lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-inquisitor">The Inquisitor</a></strong>: pragmatic servants of the gods, inquisitors concern themselves with dealing with the things that clerics and paladins don't care to sully their hands with. Worldly and canny, inquisitors are adapatable; whether their mandate involves rooting out heresy, or eliminating enemies of the faith, or weeding out things counter to their religion's best interests, an inquisitor does what is necessary.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-magus">The Magus</a></strong>: a student of both martial and mystical disciplines, able to fight with blade and spell in tandem.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-monk">The Monk</a></strong>: from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers, monks tread the path of discipline to elevate their bodies, becoming weapons of war.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-oracle">The Oracle</a></strong>: these divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-paladin">The Paladin</a></strong>: these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-ranger">The Ranger</a></strong>: knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-rogue">The Rogue</a></strong>: thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a></strong>: these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their arcane birthright and coax forth ever greater power.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-summoner">The Summoner</a></strong>: bonded to a mysterious creature called an eidolon, the summoner focuses his power on strengthening that connection and enhancing his strange, otherworldy companion.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-witch">The Witch</a></strong>: practicing a darker and older form of magic than wizards, more in tune with primeval forces. Witches, warlocks, wisdoms, and wyrds, these practitioners of practical and insidious dweomers are often maligned unfairly due to the heinous acts of a few, and thus often hide themselves away in remote hermitages, or lurk around the edges of society.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#the-wizard">The Wizard</a></strong>: these shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic.</p>
<h2 id="the-alchemist">The Alchemist</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Alchemist class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions they brew.</p>
<p>While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling.</p>
<p>Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures their own magic potential within liquids and extracts they create, infusing their chemicals with virulent power to grant impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>Alchemists tend to be roguish, and thus the advice given in the [Rogue] class translation section is also relevant to many alchemists and you might want to skim that section for general ideas. This section concentrates on content of specific interest to alchemists.</p>
<p>Alchemists make potions, elixirs, and similar <strong>concoctions</strong> and invest magical effects into them.</p>
<p>Alchemical effects most often take the form of buffs (Potion of Giant's Strength!) and utility effects (Potion of Invisibility!), but there is no restriction to enforce that. If an effect can be made to make sense narratively, it is fair game.</p>
<p>Alchemy related abilities rely heavily on Stunts, and are covered in categorical detail in the Stunt section.</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p><strong>Crafty Crafter</strong>: Arcane +2, Roguish +2</p>
<p><strong>Sapper</strong>: Combative +2, Arcane +1, Roguish +1</p>
<p><strong>Gadgeteer</strong>: Roguish +3, Arcane +1</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="stuntless-alchemy">Stuntless Alchemy</h4>
<p>A character with Arcane+3 that wants to be able to make and carry around some potions (or similar spell completion items), but doesn't want to allocate Stunt slots for such an ability has a neat and tidy option available to them.</p>
<p>Such characters can use the concept of <a href="#action-proxies">action proxies</a> described in the Simple Magic Guidelines to create &quot;alchemical items&quot; that are really action proxies.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>Alchemists have a lot of flexibility when it comes to Archetypes.</p>
<p>An alchemist will need at least <strong>Arcane</strong> +1 as most Alchemy related Stunts require it. Also, some Stunts have a limited number of uses per day or session based upon the alchemist's <strong>Arcane</strong> bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> is an excellent and very common choice for alchemists, particularly those who function like gadgeteers or trapbusters.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> allows an alchemist to present a generally skilled and competent demeanor and also to serve as a &quot;face&quot; for an adventuring group.</p>
<p>Also, alchemists tend to be well-educated free thinkers with active minds and unbridled curiosity, which leads them to pick up all manner of interesting knacks and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> +1 or +2 works well for many alchemists, particularly those with more of an &quot;internal alchemy&quot; slant.</p>
<p><strong>Combative</strong> +1 or +2 is an option for alchemists who use their alchemy to gain combat boosts, use their alchemy in an aggressive way that brings them into close combat situation, or who turn their craft to the art of the demolitionist and find work as a sapper or seige warfare specialist.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> +1 is an option for alchemists who function as herbalists or apothecaries. There's also nothing other than GM veto preventing a player from taking Alchemy Stunts that are normally based on Arcane and re-basing them on Primal.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 is a somewhat unusual choice but could be made to work for the follower of a god of medicine or invention. There's also nothing other than GM veto preventing a player from taking Alchemy Stunts that are normally based on Arcane and re-basing them on Divine.</p>
<h4 id="three-or-four-archetypes">Three Or Four Archetypes</h4>
<p>Thanks to the low Archetype requirements of Alchemy, it is feasible for an alchemist to spread themselves across three or four Archetypes, in various dispositions. This allows a character to be very broad based, though at the cost of being less specialized and thus less competitive in specific niches compared to characters that stick to one or two Archetypes.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>All Approaches are equally viable for Alchemists, but <strong>Clever</strong>, <strong>Careful</strong>, and <strong>Quick</strong> are synergistic with many Alchemy related Stunts.</p>
<h3 id="stunts-1">Stunts</h3>
<p>Alchemist characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#alchemy-stunts">Alchemy Stunts</a>, <a href="#dastardly-stunts">Dastardly Stunts</a>, <a href="#competence-stunts">Competence Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts might be of particular interest to an alchemist.</p>
<h4 id="prepared-caster-alchemy">Prepared Caster (Alchemy)</h4>
<p>While there are other ways to represent an alchemist in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, the most direct way to make a dedicated alchemist is to simply take the <strong>Prepared Caster (Alchemy)</strong> Stunt.</p>
<p>The Stunt offers good value for its Refresh equivalency due to the downside of turning off free casting for a character that takes the Stunt, and allows a dedicated alchemist to have a generous prepared item limit.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Xarren/Xarren.aspx">Xarren</a> is a learned and erudite master of internal alchemy.</p>
<p>In addition to a comprehensive knowledge of alchemical substances, he is also a skilled physicker and holds the secrets of transmogrification and rarefication of corporeal forms.</p>
<p>He seeks the fabled Praxis Perstolian Philosophica, a tome detailing an ancient system of philosophical alchemy nearly lost to the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Prepared Caster (Alchemy):</strong></p>
<p>Because of my studies as a classically trained Alchemist, given time and opportunity I may 'prepare' a number of potions, elixirs, salves and similar 'concoctions' equal to <strong>((Careful + Clever + Focused) * Arcane)</strong>.</p>
<p>Unused concoctions remain until they get activated or destroyed and can be stockpiled. These Aspects are portable; I may give them to others and they can be taken away from me.</p>
<p>Making a concoction requires time, materials, and either a lab or a field kit; the specifics are left to the GM's discretion, but simple potions might take minutes while very powerful potions might take one or more hours.</p>
<p>If a strict economy is being enforced in the campaign, it usually costs about half retail price to make a concoction; GM's discretion applies.</p>
<p>To prepare a concoction I roll 4dF and add (Focused + Arcane) against a Mediocre (+0) difficulty; failure indicates a botched concoction and that 'slot' is wasted for the day. I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the concoction I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepared concoctions are activated by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the effect of the concoction using the previously rolled margin of success. It is possible for a concoction resolution to fail if the margin of success is insufficient to the difficulty or if opposed successfully.

<p>Unfortunately due to my focus on Alchemy, I cannot free cast spells.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<p><em>Commodities</em></p>
<p>Alchemical concoctions can be given, sold to, or stolen by others and used by them. They are effectively a commodity.</p>
<p>However all of an alchemist's concoctions, including those under another character's control, count against their preparation limit.</p>
<p><em>Alchemical Item Write-ups</em></p>
<p>A variety of write-ups for [sample alchemical items] and [sample potions] are available. Each usage of these kinds of alchemical items counts against an alchemist's preparation limit.</p>
<p>Note that the provided write-ups are just examples, and not a restricted list of allowed effects; an alchemist can make any sort of alchemical item the GM allows.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p>As Prepared Casting is handled as a Stunt and Fate Accelerated characters are allowed to swap Stunts at milestones, it is technically possible for strange shenanigans to come up. However, it is recommended that Prepared Casting Stunts be anchored by a character's High Concept, and can thus only be taken or removed when an appropriate High Concept is taken or changed. This equates to character creation and major milestones, and avoids casual fluctuations.</p>

<p>An ability that is thematically &quot;alchemical&quot; can be expressed as one or more Stunts that define their own function.</p>
<p>Also, it may sometimes make sense to define such a Stunt in a way that it instead interacts with a Archetype other than the character's primary spell casting Archetype, thus expanding the breadth of the kind of effects the character can use.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Ruelga/Ruelga.aspx">Ruelga</a> is an enchantingly beautiful Jadwiga hailing from the land of Irrisen.</p>
<p>Older than she seems, Ruelga is a descendant of the legendary Baba Yaga, and heir to ancient and somewhat primitive but dangerously insidious magics including the ability to make various potions and poisons.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Theriaxis</strong>: Because I am a dedicated scholar who has mastered highly esoteric magical and medical lore, I am able to make and apply ointments, salves, nostrums, and elixirs that can heal and repair just about any form of illness, wound, infection, or impurity. While I am Carefully Arcane and I have access to my alchemical supplies, I may clear a Stress box or clear a Consequence by overcoming a difficulty equal to the numerical value of the stress box or Consequence. If I fail to overcome the difficulty of a Consequence I may not attempt to heal that same Consequence again. I may use this ability on others as well as myself if I am able to examine and treat them. I may use this ability (Focused + Arcane) times per day.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Potions, Poultices, Poisons</strong>: Because I know ancient lores from more primitive times, I am able to brew potions, poultices, and poisons that can harm and heal and work odd and subtle magics on those who imbide them. I can be Cleverly Arcane and make substances that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. At any given time I can have a number of substances brewed up and ready for use equal to my Arcane + Primal capability.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Restorative Elixir</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later use restorative elixirs.</p>
<p>When I am Carefully Focused I gain +3 to overcome vs a Superb (+5) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful I remove all debilitating situational Aspects currently affecting my health or normal functioning that have a difficulty to remove of Great (+4) or less. This does not work on environmental Aspects, scene Aspects, or other situational Aspects that affect me externally, it only works against situational Aspects that affect me directly and personally such as poison, fatigue, some spells, curses, and so forth.</p>
<p>Additionally, if I am successful, I may also clear one of my stress boxes or a Mild Consequence.</p>
<p>To use this ability I must be able to access the elixir and drink its contents.</p>
<p>For a given session I can make and carry around a number of Restorative Elixirs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my restorative elixirs, but only gain +1 while Carefully Focused when using one of them. Restorative elixirs given to others do count against my per-session limit.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="bombs-1">Bombs</h4>
<p>Chucking &quot;bombs&quot; or grenade-like weapons can be an effective and memorable way for an alchemist to make their presense felt when things get ugly.</p>
<p>One way to approach alchemical bombs is to treat them as merely a way to inflict stress on multiple targets.</p>
<p>It is also possible to define bombs that do other things, such as <strong>Sticky Bombs</strong>, or bombs that disrupt specific kinds of opponents such as <strong>Holly Water Vials</strong>.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Olivin/Olivin.aspx">Olivin</a> is an experienced globadier, dropping gas bombs and other alchemical devices to befuddle and harm his adversaries.</p>
<p>And when that doesn't get the job done, he's got a bunch of other alchemical tricks tucked away in various belt pouches and pockets.</p>
<p>Which is fortunate, since his penchant for snooping gets Olivin in over his head frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Acid Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical acid bombs. When I am Quickly Focused I gain +3 to attack a target within two (2) zones of me by throwing an alchemical acid bomb at them.</p>
<p>If I am successful, the acid bomb shatters, splashing its contents upon my target and inflicting damage as stress normally, but if I succeed with style, I must reduce the stress to get a boost and the boost is upgraded to the situational Aspect <strong>Acid Burn!</strong> which is attached to the target.</p>
<p>This Aspect is automatically invoked at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress to the target per invoke. This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of acid bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my acid bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alchemical Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical bombs. When I am Cleverly Focused I gain +1 to throw a bomb into my zone or an adjacent zone, generally against an Average (+1) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful, my bomb explodes and inflicts a number of shifts of damage equal to my (Careful + Arcane) against every target in the zone without splitting shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of alchemical bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can not catalyze my bombs, they are only usable by me.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Gas Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical gas bombs.</p>
<p>When I am Carefully Focused I gain +3 to attack a target zone within two (2) zones of me by throwing an alchemical gas bomb.</p>
<p>If I am successful the gas bomb shatters, releasing toxic fumes and applying the situational Aspect <strong>Toxic Gas!</strong> to the zone with two free invokes.</p>
<p>This Aspect is automatically invoked now and at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress per invoke to every target within the affected zone that needs to breathe. This Aspect can be removed by strong winds or focused air by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of gas bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my gas bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Holy Water Vials</strong>: Because I have learned a special alchemical recipe, I am able to make a mildly magical mixture containing holly water, garlic, powdered silver, and grave dust that causes harm to the undead. These vials can be thrown, with the liquid splashing out upon impact to inflict harm on an undead creature.</p>
<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +4 to attack an undead target within one (1) zone of me.</p>
<p>If I am successful, the holly water vial shatters, splashing its contents upon my target and inflicting damage as stress normally, but this damage <strong>cannot be reduced</strong> by any innate ability of the target (other forms of protection such as a magic item or a spell do apply).</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of holly water vials equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my holly water vials; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sticky Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical sticky bombs.</p>
<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +3 to create advantage against a target within two (2) zones of me by throwing a sticky bomb at them.</p>
<p>If I am successful, the sticky bomb shatters, splashing its sticky contents upon my target, attaching the situational Aspect <strong>Trapped By Sticky Goo!</strong> to the target with three (3) invokes. While this Aspect is in play, the target is rooted in their current zone and thus cannot move to another zone. This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+4) difficulty, but each failed attempt to overcome it expends an invoke.</p>
<p>This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+4) difficulty. However when it is expended or removed a second situational Aspect, <strong>Sticky Goo Residue!</strong>, is attached to the target with four (4) invokes. The second Aspect prevents the target from moving more than one (1) zone per action, and they cannot both move and attack. The second Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Superb (+6) difficulty, but each failed attempt to overcome it expends an invoke.</p>
<p>Note that this ability can cause flying targets to plummet to the ground if they use winged flight.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of sticky bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my sticky bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="mutagens-1">Mutagens</h4>
<p>While they may also grant secondary benefits, the fundamental nature of mutagen Stunts is to allow a character to temporarily move their Approaches and / or Archetype bonuses around to a different disposition suited to an alternate physical form.</p>
<p>This can range from &quot;hulking out&quot;, to taking on the forms and natural abilities of animals, or something more unusual.</p>
<p>As this kind of ability is unusually powerful and offers a tremendous amount of flexibility to a single character, it is usually appropriate for this sort of Stunt to cost a Fate point or have scene or session limits. However, the higher the Refresh equivalency of a Stunt the less restricted it needs to be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, GM's discretion applies heavily to this sort of ability.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Bruteform)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity, becoming much larger and stronger but at the cost of greatly diminished intellgence. I may spend a Fate point to temporarily move all of my Approach bonuses to Forceful (leaving all of my other Approaches at +0), and to move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). I also change my Trouble to <strong>'Mutagenic Brute'</strong>. This lasts for an entire scene unless I spend another Fate point to change back to normal.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Beastshape; -2)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity, taking on the forms of animals. I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form.</p>
<p>When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). This lasts for an entire scene unless I choose to return to normal, which ends the effect. Additionally, I may spend another Fate point to assume a different animal's form, and I do not have to first change back to normal.</p>
<p>When I change forms I gain an additional Aspect named for the animal form I have assumed which I can invoke when my current animal form is relevant, and which can be compelled whenever my animal form or lack of humanoid anatomy might inconvenience me.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has natural weapons I may use Focused in place of Combatives while in a physical conflict.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Elementalform, -2)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity. I may spend two (2) Fate points to temporarily change into an Elemental.</p>
<p>When I activate this effect I must choose Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. For the duration of the effect I use the Large Elemental write-up for the elemental type I have chosen instead of my own character write-up. (See <a href="#sample-mutagen-elemental-forms">sample mutagen elemental forms</a> for example elemental types.)</p>
<p>My transformation lasts for an entire scene but I may change back to my normal form at any time, ending the effect.</p>
<p>My trappings change with me and are inaccessible for the duration of the effect.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>

<h3 id="source-material-notes">Source Material Notes</h3>
<p>Pathfinder alchemists are less brewers of potions and more of an odd combination of Dr. Jekyl &amp; Mr. Hyde crossed with a Mad Bomber. There is no need to take that particular path in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, but for those who want to adhere to the source material such abilities can easily be handled by Stunts.</p>
<h2 id="the-barbarian">The Barbarian</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Barbarian class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves.</p>
<p>With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know.</p>
<p>Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors---they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war.</p>
<p>Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail.</p>
<p>These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-1">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Tribal Warrior</strong>: Combative +3, Focused +1</p>
<p><strong>Savage</strong>: Combative +2, Focused +1, Primal +1</p>
<p><strong>Brute</strong>: Combative +2, Focused +2</p>
<p><strong>Manbeast</strong>: Focused +3, Primal +1</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-1">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>Three Archetypes are relevant to the barbarian concept, though a particular barbarian only needs some combination of two of them.</p>
<p><strong>Combatives</strong> covers the &quot;warrior&quot; facet of the barbarian, while <strong>Focused</strong> covers the &quot;unsullied physical specimen&quot; facet, and <strong>Primal</strong> covers the &quot;master of uncivilized wildlands&quot; facet.</p>
<p>Pathfinder type barbarians tend to favor Combatives and the <strong>Tribal Warrior</strong> set of Starting Archetypes is probably the closest match. The <strong>Savage</strong> set of Starting Archetypes is a good match for most &quot;old school&quot; barbarians from earlier editions of D &amp; D as well as pulp fiction.</p>
<p>The <strong>Brute</strong> or <strong>Manbeast</strong> sets of Starting Archetypes are a good way to go for more of a burly unstoppable force or wildman sort of barbarian.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> is the least essential Archetype of the three for a barbarian; +0 to +1 is sufficient for most barbarians, with +2 being unusual but not entirely outre. <strong>Primal</strong> +3 and higher blurs the concept and starts to drift into druid or ranger territory.</p>
<p><strong>Combatives</strong> is the most superficially obvious Archetype for a barbarian, but actually isn't all that essential as <strong>Focused</strong> can very easily be made to do double duty in conflicts at the cost of one or more Stunt slots.</p>
<p><strong>Combatives</strong> from +0 and higher works just fine with no upper limit, so long as it doesn't completely overshadow the other facets of the character to the point that the supposed barbarian is indistinguishable from Johnny Fighter from the Big City.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> is the most defining Archetype of the three, harkening back to Robert Howard's envisioning of barbarians at the dawn of the Sword &amp; Sorcery genre. All barbarians should have at least <strong>Focused</strong> +1.</p>
<p>Unlike monks and psions and other character types that favor high <strong>Focused</strong> who start evincing supernatural or normalcy-defying abilities at +3 and higher, barbarians tend to show their exceptionalism by exaggerating all of their innate attributes to be flat out superior to other normal people. They are objectively stronger, tougher, quicker of wit, more perceptive, and faster than ordinary men...particularly <em>'civilized'</em> men (with civilized being used as a pejorative meaning weak and decadent).</p>
<p>Scaling impossible cliffs, wrestling with gorillas and winning, seeing further than a hawk, speaking so many languages learned from their travels that a scholarly linguist would be put to shame...things like that.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-1">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Barbarians are rarely <strong>Careful</strong>, but some like to lay a <strong>Sneaky</strong> ambush from time to time.</p>
<p>Though they rarely have a formal education many barbarians are surprisingly <strong>Clever</strong>, gifted with natural intellect sharpened by the harsh realities of survival.</p>
<p>Many, perhaps most, barbarians are <strong>Forceful</strong>, but some grandstanders trend more towards <strong>Flashy</strong>. And barbarians are often <strong>Quick</strong> for their size.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-barbarian-exactly">What Kind Of Barbarian, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;barbarian&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is my barbarian more of a feral brute or a &quot;noble savage&quot;?</li>
<li>Is my barbarian more of a physical phenom super-athelete or a fearsome warrior?</li>
<li>How does my barbarian defeat their enemies?</li>
<li>Is my barbarian a berserker?</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, a fearsome but noble warrior of a remote village of hillfolk who spent his formative years helping the warriors of the tribe fend off the predations of a nearby clan of ogres is more of a Combatives based character with either Focused or Primal or a split, while a hulking brute raised by bears who lived on his own until captured and sold as a pit fighting slave but ultimately broke loose and slew his &quot;owners&quot; would be more of a Focused and Primal based character.</p>
<p>The fourth question is where things get sticky.</p>
<h4 id="feral-or-noble-savage">Feral or Noble Savage?</h4>
<p>Some barbarians are pretty primitive, perhaps even vestiges of an earlier age. Others are part of a vibrant and rich culture that has not succumbed to the decadent lure of so-called civilization.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder setting of Golarion has a number of suitable cultures for a barbarian to originate from, such as the Mammoth Lords, or the Shoanti, or the people who inhabit the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.</p>
<p>Answering this question will fill in your character's background and will probably also influence your High Concept. It might very well also drive your selection of Trouble, other Aspects, and Stunts.</p>
<h4 id="physical-phenom-or-fearsome-warrior">Physical Phenom or Fearsome Warrior?</h4>
<p>Some barbarians are just physically and perhaps mentally overpowering, and rely on their innate superiority to defeat lesser folks. Other barbarians come from a culture with a proud warrior tradition, and they learn skill at arms from childhood on up in due course to being recognized as an adult.</p>
<p>Answering this question will influence your choice of Archetypes, and possibly Approaches as well. It will also impact whatever trappings your character might carry, and may inspire one or more of your Aspects and Stunts.</p>
<p>For a physical phenom type of barbarian, favor <strong>Focused</strong> +2 or +3. For a barbarian from a rich warrior tradition, consider <strong>Combatives</strong> +1 or +2. For a barbarian from a culture that lives rough in the wildlands such as nomads or hillfolk, consider <strong>Primal</strong> +1 or +2.</p>
<p>With Stunt support you might also consider <strong>Focused</strong> +4 and play a character akin to <a href="#the-monk">the monk</a>, but with the background and attitude of a barbarian.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Kazzar/Kazzar.aspx">Kazzar</a> is a barbarian thug blessed with astounding physical prowess, but not as gifted in the realm of mental faculties. Utterly ignorant and out of place in civilized lands, this crude lout thumps those who have things he wants and takes their shinies. Still alive only due to his nearly supernatural resilience and prowess, this brutish half orc careens through existence from one disastrous misadventure to another.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="conquest-or-dominance">Conquest or Dominance?</h4>
<p>Barbarians embrace the harsh reality of life, which is that strife is inevitable. In a cruel and brutal world violence is sometimes necessary, even if it is thrust upon you. How a given barbarian prefers to combat their enemies says a lot about them.</p>
<p>Some barbarians prefer to meet violence head on, eye to eye, blades crossed and to the victor goes the spoils. Others are more crafty and prefer to lure their foolish foes into the wildlands and harry them unmercifully. Some barbarians are content to physically defeat their opponents and be done with it, but others must also prove themselves superior first and crush their enemies will to fight before striking the final blow.</p>
<p>Most barbarians are completely ok with doing whatever they feel like and taking whatever they want by force, but others have codes of warrior honor or must adhere to complex traditions or rites which constrain their actions with nearly as much stringency as a paladin's vows.</p>
<p>Thinking about these nuances should help you shade in the subtleties of your barbarian's personality and world view, and possibly firm up an Aspect and / or a Stunt.</p>
<h4 id="to-berserk-or-not-berserk">To Berserk Or Not Berserk?</h4>
<p>In Pathfinder, a barbarian is always a berserker, baring any &quot;archetype&quot; (as defined in the Pathfinder rule books) shenanigans. The class might as well have been called &quot;The Berserker&quot;.</p>
<p>There is much to be said for going the berserker route; from a roleplaying perspective barbarians tend to be easy to play as the concept has a way of rendering decision making very easy when portraying one. See a threat, get angry and smash it.</p>
<p>However there is also much to be said for not making your barbarian a berserker, harkening back to the idea of the barbarian <strong>pre-D&amp;D 3e</strong>. Whether your flavor is an <strong>AD&amp;D 2e</strong> or <strong>AD&amp;D 1e Unearthed Arcana</strong> barbarian, or further back to something from swords &amp; sorcery pulp fiction, or if your inspiration comes from a real world people such as the Vikings or the Mongols, there is a broad design space to operate within to make interesting characters.</p>
<h5 id="i-am-not-a-berzerker">I Am NOT A Berzerker!</h5>
<p>If you decide that your character is not a berserker, i.e. is not anchored on the idea of entering a violent rage to fight opponents, then you are free to allocate your Aspects and Stunts however you like to make your character interesting to you.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Oarg/Oarg.aspx">Oarg</a> is an example of a barbarian who is not a berzerker. He's an extremely big, physically dominant, uncivilized brute, but he's eager to expand his horizons by exploring the many wonders of the world.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="i-am-a-berzerker">I Am A Berzerker!</h5>
<p>If your character is a berserker, then you should make sure to incorporate that idea into their Aspects. If it is the dominant idea of the character, then it should be reflected in their High Concept. If your character's propensity towards anger causes problems in their life, work that into the character's Trouble.</p>
<p>When it comes to making your character's berzerk rage impact 4dF outcomes, the simplest option is to maintain a reserve of Fate points and spend them to invoke the character's anger-related Aspect or High Concept when anger might be helpful and you want a mechanical bonus.</p>
<p>Another option is you can use one or more create advantage actions to attach a situational Aspect (or add invokes to your character's Aspect or High Concept) to yourself indicating your character's ire and use any free invokes on it, thereby conserving your Fate points but otherwise having the same end result.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want something more concrete or reliable, you probably will want to use at least one Stunt slot defining how your character benefits from their berserk rage. Decide how you want your character's rage to benefit them and make a Stunt that enables your idea. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Kiroee/Kiroee.aspx">Kiroee</a> is an iconic barbarian who is driven by her unfocused but boundless rage! The full profundity of her constant ire is reflected in her High Concept, focused further in one of her Aspects, and is suggested at in her Trouble.</p>
<p>And she has several Stunts that key into her berzerker nature. Her &quot;Anger Management&quot; Stunt is the engine that drives it all, automatically adding free invokes to her own High Concept but at a cost; these invokes can be used as necessary to represent her enraged potency. Secondarily her &quot;Swift Fury&quot; Stunt allows her to use those invokes specifically for extra movement so that she can close with enemies and smash them.</p>
<p>Finally her &quot;Attack Attack ATTACK!!!!&quot; Stunt, though not directly tied in to her anger, illustrates her reckless all-out aggression and rounds the character out as a fearsome foe to face in a conflict, but easy to land hits on.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-2">Stunts</h3>
<p>Barbarian characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#primordial-stunts">Primordial Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>, <a href="#competence-stunts">Competence Stunts</a>, <a href="#innate-stunts">Innate Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some barbarians. However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="physical-specimens">Physical Specimens</h4>
<p>Many barbarians are exceptionally fit and athletic, with sharp senses, agility, strength, and durability.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Damage Reduction</strong>: Because I am more durable than normal, I reduce by one (1) all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dodgy</strong>: Because I am good at getting out of the way of danger, I gain +1 to defend when I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Incorrigibly Competitive</strong>: Because I am incorrigibly competitive and driven to win, I gain +2 while Flashily Focused to create advantage or overcome when engaged in any kind of one on one physical, mental, or social contest, ranging from duels to drinking contests to arm wrestling bouts to put-down matches to poker face offs and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Reduction</strong>: Because I am significantly more rugged, robust, and survivable due to my deep connection with primal forces, I reduce by one (1) all physical stress inflicted on me, and I reduce by two (2) all environmental stress inflicted on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Raw Charisma</strong>: Because I am naturally likeable and charismatic, I may use Focused instead of Roguish for social interactions related to making friends and influencing people. I gain +1 while Focused to create advantage or overcome challenges when using this Stunt. However some people innately distrust charming people, and I sometimes meet unexpected friction to my overtures.</p>
<p>When using this Stunt I can be compelled by the GM to fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Because of my impressive resilience, once per session if I would take a Consequence I may instead spend a Fate point.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Warrior's Mettle</strong>: Because I have trained extensively and am made of sterner stuff than most people, I may use Combatives to defend against ranged attacks and targeted magic by deflecting such attacks with a precise flick or parry of my weapon, or with my armor or a shield, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Combative +2 to use.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Combative +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Combative +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Very Strong</strong>: Because I am so strong, I get +2 while I am Forcefully Focused and create advantage or overcome when my great strength is a factor.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="aggressive-warriors">Aggressive Warriors</h4>
<p>Many barbarians fight with incredible vigor and ferocity, overwhelming foes with the sheer force of their unrelenting assault.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Aggressive Assault</strong>: Because I am driven to extreme aggression, when I am Forcefully Combative and attack I may add from one to four additional Fate dice to my 4dF attack roll and choose the four best dice as my result. However, until my next exchange whenever I defend I add the same number of Fate dice to my defend rolls and choose the four worst dice as my result.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Barbarian Beatdown</strong>: Because I'm able to use my athleticism and physical advantages to good effect in a fight, I may use Focused instead of Combative when fighting with an appropriate weapon.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Barehanded Fighting</strong>: Because my fighting skills include barehanded combat, I may use Combative instead of Focused when fighting barehanded or grappling.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Brawler</strong>: Because I am so strong, I get +2 while I am Forcefully Focused and attack when fighting unarmed or grappling or when throwing heavy blunt things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bums Rush</strong>: Because I like to overwhelm others, I get +2 when I am Forceful and attempt to tackle or bowl over an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Forcefully Aggressive</strong>: Because I am so physically powerful, I get +1 when I am Forceful and attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fueled By Suffering</strong>: Because I channel my pain and suffering and become more dangerous when I am in danger, when I take stress or consequences from attacks I gain a Boost called <strong>Fueled By Suffering</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Indomitable</strong>: Because I refuse to give in and I always vigorously protect myself, I get +1 when I am Forceful and defend if I am aware that I am in danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Making It Count</strong>: Because I am able to make my attacks really matter, on an attack that succeeds with style I may spend a fate point to prevent the target from checking a stress box to reduce the stress of the attack. The target may still take consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>One Against Many</strong>: Because I am skilled at defending myself against multiple attackers, I gain +2 to defend when I fight alone against two or more opponents. A single mook defined as a mob counts as being multiple opponents for purposes of this ability as long as there are two or more 'individuals' within the mob. 'Fighting alone' in this context means no allies are in my zone or an adjacent zone, and no ally is aiding me or attacking my opponents.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pounce!</strong>: Because I excel at leaping into combat in a startling burst of aggression, I gain +4 on my first attack in a conflict if I act first and can charge, lunge at, or pounce upon an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Powerful Attack</strong>: Because I am so skilled at delivering forceful attacks, I gain +2 when I am Forcefully Combative and attack while armed with a weapon.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Push Beyond The Edge</strong>: Because I fight to the bitter end no matter what the cost, at any time as a non action if my Severe consequence is currently clear I may choose to either worsen my Moderate consequence (if any) to a Severe consequence or take a new Severe consequence <strong>Pushed Myself Too Far</strong> to clear my Mild Consequences and all my Stress boxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Retribution</strong>: Because my retribution is terrible when I succesfully attack an opponent who has inflicted stress or consequences upon me in the current conflict I inflict +1 shift more damage and this damage cannot be reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Terrifying Roar</strong>: Because I am able to make a terrifying noise, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize. Alternately, once per scene if I move a zone and attack while Flashy I may also attempt to create advantage to frighten or demoralize everyone in the same zone as my target as a free action.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="unsullied-by-civilization">Unsullied By Civilization</h4>
<p>Barbarians generally eshew the so-called advantages of civilization, regarding city life as decadent and regressive. They instead take great pride in more practical skills such as using one's environment effectively, living off the land, being skilled at the hunt, and remaining adaptable to whatever situation they might find themselves in.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Ambusher</strong>: Because I am great at setting up ambushes, I gain +1 when I Sneakily set up an ambush or create a related advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Just Roll With It</strong>: Because I excel at avoiding harm and rolling with whatever comes my way, I can use more than one stress box to absorb stress from an attack (normally, only one stress box may be used to offset stress from a single attack).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Living Off The Land</strong>: Because I am adept at surviving off of what nature offers me, I am always able to find enough food and water to keep myself and a couple of other people or animals healthy while in wildlands and rural areas (i.e. above ground and not near a city or town). Additionally if I've had at least half a day to become familiar with the terrain in a specific area of wilderness I gain +1 on all actions while being Primal. How large the area of wilderness might be is left to the GM's discretion, but it should be at least five square miles.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Naturally Sneaky</strong>: Because I am innately good at being sneaky, I may use Focused instead of Roguish or Primal when Sneakily attempting to avoid notice. However, I suffer a -1 penalty when I do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Naturally Sneaky (-2)</strong>: Because I am innately good at being sneaky, I may use Focused instead of Roguish or Primal when Sneakily attempting to avoid notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rural Warrior</strong>: Because I am skilled at using practical, functional weapons such as hunting spears and bows, woodsman axes, cudgels, lariats, and weapons derived from farming equipment I am a surprisingly effective combatant when armed appropriately. Though my fighting style is no-frills and straightforward, when armed with an appropriate weapon I can use Focused in place of Combatives in armed physical conflicts and I gain +1 to create advantage attempts that utilize my unusual weaponry in interesting ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Strider</strong>: Because I am fleet of foot and able to move quickly, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an extra zone and I am unobstructed by foot hazards of less than knee height. If I am in a contest involving me walking rapidly or running, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-1">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="self-buffing-striker">Self-buffing Striker</h4>
<p>The source material has a very particular expression of &quot;barbarians&quot; as combat focused characters who have the ability to &quot;rage&quot;, which is essentially a &quot;self-buff&quot; offering improved combat numbers that gets progressively better as the barbarian character levels up.</p>
<h4 id="savage-fitness">Savage Fitness</h4>
<p>Additionally a barbarian gets an improved movement rate, more hit points, eventually becomes more resistent to damage, gains the ability to avoid traps, hyper reflexes allowing the evasion of various kinds of threats, and so on.</p>
<p>There are also various &quot;rage&quot; related feats that may be taken to kit out or leverage the raging buff for various purposes, and a selection of &quot;archetypes&quot; (as defined in the Pathfinder rule books) that allow the tailoring of class abilties to better suit a concept.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>Pathfinder and D&amp;D 3e offer up the barbarian as a raging brute, while earlier editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons presented an uncivilized barbarian unsullied by the decadence of city life; generally more &quot;Conan&quot; and less &quot;Roid Rage&quot;. And there is a good deal of sword &amp; sorcery fiction to draw on for inspiration.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn't feel obligated to adhere to source material; you are free to be creative. Assign your Approach and Archetype bonuses, and define your character's Aspects and Stunts to best realize <em>your</em> &quot;barbarian&quot; concept.</p>
<h2 id="the-bard">The Bard</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Bard class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-2">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Gish</strong>: Combative +1, Roguish +1, Arcane +2</p>
<p><strong>Dilettante</strong>: Combative +1, Roguish +1, Focused +1, ??? +1</p>
<p><strong>Jack-of-all-Trades</strong>: Focused +4</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-2">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>Due to the diversity of the bardic concept, choice of Archetypes for a given individual bard is also diverse.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;bard&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself:</p>
<p>&quot;Am I trying to adhere to the conception of a bard put forth in a specific version of the source material, or am I doing my own thing?&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>If the answer is &quot;doing my own thing&quot;, you should also ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is my character more of a musician or a loremaster?</li>
<li>Is my character more of a front-line combatant or a team supporter?</li>
<li>Is my character a spellcaster, and if so what kind?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="celtic-hero-and-master-of-lore">Celtic Hero And Master Of Lore</h4>
<p>A player trying to make a more 1e AD&amp;D style bard would start off with Combative and Roguish, and perhaps Primal +1.</p>
<p>Then, over the course of three to five major milestones, crank up Primal to at least +3 to gain druidic spell casting.</p>
<h4 id="musically-talented-gish">Musically Talented Gish</h4>
<p>A player trying to make a more 2e AD&amp;D style bard would start off with Combative +1, Roguish +1, Arcane +2, or Roguish +2, Arcane +2, and a Stunt to augment the use of Roguish for physical conflicts.</p>
<p>As major milestones pass, spread Archetype bonuses around evenly.</p>
<h4 id="magical-minstrel-cheerleader">Magical Minstrel Cheerleader</h4>
<p>A player trying to make a 3e D&amp;D style bard would start off with Arcane +3, Focused +1, and several Stunts to cover bardic performance and bardic knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="the-jack-of-all-trades">The Jack-of-all-Trades</h4>
<p>Another approach is to take Focused +4 and a Stunt called Jack-of-all-Trades, which allows a character to be able to do just about anything at the cost of burning Fate points.</p>
<div class="Descriptino">
<p><strong>Jack-of-all-Trades (-3)</strong>: Because I am a jack of all trades who has studied an array of different crafts, during a scene I may spend a fate point as a free action to allow myself to use Focused as if it were any one other Archetype for the remainder of the scene. I may activate this ability multiple times per scene to use more than one Archetype, spending an additional fate point each time.</p>
</div>
<p>However, the number of Stunt slots the Stunt requires and the constant use of fate points imposes both a steep opportunity cost as well as a lack of sustainability.</p>
<p>The trick to making this sort of a character work is having a good Trouble that can reliably be compelled, such as <strong>Dangerously Curious</strong>, or <strong>Can't Mind My Own Business</strong>, or <strong>Danger Magnet</strong>.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Adriel/Adriel.aspx">Adriel</a> is an adaptable adventurer mentored by a crusty crew of heroes in many things, including the art of the blade, magic, druidic lore, and the way of the dodgy path.</p>
<p>Competent and capable, she seeks a grand destiny promised to her by an aged druid.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="doing-my-own-thing">Doing My Own Thing</h4>
<p>A player striking off on their own is free to mix and match their Archetypes to suit their concept.</p>
<p>One option is to go the dilettante route of Combative +1, Roguish +1, Focused +1, and either Arcane +1 or Primal +1.</p>
<p>This offers a wide base of basic ability, and is easy to build on as major milestones accrue.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Nomis/Nomis.aspx">Nomis</a> is a rebelious son of a barbarian champion, and a bit of a dilettante. A lover rather than a fighter, quick to make friends instead of enemies, glib of tongue and verse.</p>
<p>Nomis would rather carouse than conflict, but unfortunately he seems to be marked by destiny to live an interesting life, blown upon the winds of fortune into high adventure and derring do.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Orlo/Orlo.aspx">Orlo</a> is an arrogant scion of a nearly extinct line claiming Azlanti heritage. Born with a rare mystical gift to see divinitory signs, and bearing a powerful magical sword that has been in his family for generations, he is well along on a personal journey to find a wife of unsullied lineage.</p>
<p>As <a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Orlo/Epic/Orlo.aspx">he gains in experience</a> Orlo might further develop his latent magical abilities and improve his warrior skills.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-2">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Very few bards are <strong>Forceful</strong> as they typically prefer finesse and subtlety. However, a more aggressive or take charge bard might buck the general trend.</p>
<p>Bards are stereotypically <strong>Clever</strong> and often flamboyantly <strong>Flashy</strong>.</p>
<p>Some bards are notably <strong>Quick</strong>, and a few who practice skulduggery or espionage are <strong>Sneaky</strong> and <strong>Careful</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="stunts-3">Stunts</h3>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some bards.</p>
<p>However, bard characters are so diverse any given bard might find any given Stunt of use. A variety of <a href="#sample-stunts">Sample Stunts</a> are for browsing.</p>
<p>And, of course, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept...so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="socially-intelligent-entertainers">Socially Intelligent Entertainers</h4>
<p>Many bards are educated (or can fake it), observant, keen of wit, understanding of the nuances of interpersonal communication, know how to work a crowd, and how to blend in. Some bards are well connected, others excel at making fast friends whereever they might find themselves, and still others have a knack for finding wealthy patrons.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Aristocrat</strong>: Because I am the heir to an aristocratic line with history entangled with a nation state, ruling dynasty, or region I am afforded respect, deference, and access to those in power far exceeding anything justified by my own merit. The benefit of this is tied to the political influence and power of whatever land or people my lineage is attached to and in some situations can even be a compellable hindrance; GM's discretion applies.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Can't We Find A Way To 'Work This Out'Non-violently?</strong>: Because I am able to appeal to the baser instincts of most people and appear extremely 'likeable', I'm good at avoiding unwanted conflict and changing the nature of interaction from physical conflict to a mental and social contest. I gain +2 whenever I attempt to avoid or end a conflict via non-violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Charming And Coy</strong>: Because I am adept at manipulating social situations to my benefit, I gain +1 when I am Roguish and engage in a social challenge, contest, or conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Deceitful</strong>: Because I am so deceitful, I get +2 when I am Cleverly Roguish and create advantage or overcome challenges where my smooth patter applies.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Friendly Diplomacy</strong>: Because I am charmingly friendly to almost everyone and am good at making friends and calming situations down, I gain +2 whenever I attempt to avoid or end a conflict via non-violence, keep the peace, or improve the 'mood of the room'.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Morale Boosting Performance</strong>: Because I am a naturally gifted performer, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Focused and create subtle advantages affecting morale or mental states, or help others overcome challeges by motivating them, when I am able to make music. I can also make long journeys less boring when stealth is not required, and make some spare coin performing at taverns and such.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Seductive Domination</strong>: Because I have the ability to take control of the minds of others by seducing them, while I am Sneakily Focused I can employ a vaneer of seduction or other predatory social wiles against a living target in my zone that I am in close contact with. Each exchange I continue my seduction I may make mental attacks against the target. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against their nature (i.e. they may resist one of my commands if they have a relevant Aspect). If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences. This is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Focused +3 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sense Deceit</strong>: Because I am so skilled at sensing people's true motives, I gain +2 when I am Cleverly Roguish and attempt to discern if I am being deceived or tricked.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="graced-existence">Graced Existence</h4>
<p>Many bards seem to enjoy a graced existence, more fortunate than they have any right to be, favored by fate, destined for greater things, or blessed with dumb luck.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Better Lucky Than Good</strong>: Because I am unusually lucky, whenever I make a 4dF resolution roll and the result is 0 0 0 0 (all + + + + (all pluses).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Charmed Existence</strong>: Because I lead a charmed existence, whenever I roll - - - - (all minuses) on 4dF I treat it as if I rolled 0 0 0 0 (all blanks).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Close Call</strong>: Because I excel at getting out of really bad situations, I can spend a fate point to concede after I already rolled to defend (normally a concession must be made instead of rolling to defend).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fated Fortune</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects I gain a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Favored By Fortune</strong>: Because I am unusually lucky, I add +1 shift to my total whenever I make a 4dF resolution roll and there are no minuses (-) in the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Nothing Succeeds Like Success (-3)</strong>: Because nothing succeeds like success, when I succeed with style and gain a boost I may upgrade that boost to a situational Aspect on myself called <strong>On A Roll!</strong> with two (2) invokes on it. If the Aspect is already active, I instead add two (2) more free invokes to it. The Aspect is removed at the end of the scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Slip Away (-2)</strong>: Because I am excellent at getting away with it and slipping away unseen, if there is a momentary distraction or opportunity I may spend a Fate point to immediately exit the scene by means appropriate to the narrative such as slippling away into a crowd, or through a hidden door to a secret escape hatch I happened to know about, or by using a magic item I happened to have, etc. I cannot be pursued in the current scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sublime Expertise (-2)</strong>: Because I am extremely skilled and rarely blunder, whenever I make a 4dF roll I treat any result of less than 0 as -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Thrive Under Pressure</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects to gain a +2 bonus on an action before I roll, if I succeed with style I get the fate point back immediately instead of gaining a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Universal Linguist</strong>: Because I have a special ability with languages, I can fluently speak and understand any spoken language I encounter.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wheeler Dealer</strong>: Because I excel at talking my way into and out of situations and making deals, I gain +2 while Cleverly Roguish in social situations.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="no-stranger-to-the-blade">No Stranger To The Blade</h4>
<p>Though most bards tend to prefer non-violent resolutions, many bards are nonetheless adept with some manner of weapon, or can otherwise account for themselves when steel is drawn.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Duelist</strong>: Because I am skilled at the art of using weapons such as thinblades, foils, rapiers, epees, sabres, and stilettos (i.e, 'dueling' weapons), I am a surprisingly effective combatant when armed appropriately. Though my fighting style remains agile and even acrobatic at times, when armed with an appropriate weapon I can use Focused in place of Combatives in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Forbidding Presence</strong>: Because I present a very intimidating and stern visage while emanating a frightenting aura, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Impressive Reflexes</strong>: Because I have excellent reflexes, I gain +1 while Quickly attacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Riposte</strong>: Because even my defense is dangerous, whenever I am Flashily Focused and defend with style against a physical melee attack while wielding a dueling weapon I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on my attacker, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Tumbler</strong>: Because I am excellent at acrobatically flipping around and tumbling, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an additional zone and I am unobstructed by minor obstacles that I can tumble around or flip over. If I am in a contest involving me running away from something or avoiding capture, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="magically-adept">Magically Adept</h4>
<p>Some bards are more than merely mundane, having one or more mystical abilities that mark them out above the common man.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Senses</strong>: Because I have developed my arcane senses to impressive heights, I may use Arcane instead of Focused to notice or perceive things and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heed Me!</strong>: Because I have a magical knack that allows me to augment my spoken voice with enchanting magics I may use Arcane for social interactions if I can talk and my target can hear me. I am resisted by Arcane when I do so. This is a form of mind-affecting magic.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mage Armor Knack</strong>: <strong>Because I have a minor magical knack, I can create advantage while Carefully Arcane vs an Average (+1) difficulty to apply the Aspect Mage Armor</strong> to myself. While this Aspect is active I gain +2 when defending against physical or damaging magical attacks. This Aspect may also be invoked to offer additional protection when defending from physical or magical harm. This Aspect can be overcome and removed as a Superb (+5) difficulty by those with Arcane +3 or higher.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Secret Signs</strong>: Because I have an unusual mystical talent I sometimes see signs, portents, and sigils that provide me with information about the present or near future that I could not possibly know otherwise. I gain +2 while I am Focused and create advantage when I attempt to discover or notice some detail, fact, Aspect, or truth about the scene, or a person or group in it, even if it would not normally be possible for me to know or detect this information with merely mundane senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Willful Invisibility</strong>: Because I can turn invisibile at will, if I do not attack or create advantage in an exchange I may place the situational Aspect <strong>'Invisible'</strong> on myself as a free action that takes no time before or after my normal action. If I attack or create advantage while invisible, this Aspect is immediately removed and I become visibile for at least one (1) exchange before I am able to use this ability to become invisible again. My innate invisibility can be temporarily neutralized by those with unusual senses or magic or special items creating an applicable advantage; the difficulty to do so is Superb (+5). It can also be overcome and thus removed by some abilities that explicitly counter invisibility or dispel magic; the difficulty to do so is Fantastic (+6).</p>

<h4 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h4>
<p>Bard spellcasters might be interested in <a href="#arcanist-stunts">Arcanist Stunts</a>, <a href="#primordial-stunts">Primordial Stunts</a>, or <a href="#deific-stunts">Deific Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>As explained in the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a> guidelines, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows characters with <strong>Arcane</strong>, <strong>Divine</strong>, or <strong>Primal</strong> of +3 and higher to cast spells.</p>
<p>If you plan on playing a spellcasting bard, you should familiarize yourself with the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a> guidelines at a minimum, and you might want to glance over various available <a href="#simple-magic-options">simple magic options</a> to see if anything catches your interest.</p>
<h5 id="free-casting-vs-prepared-casting">Free Casting vs Prepared Casting</h5>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows free casting by default, but some players might prefer their cleric to be a Prepared Caster; see <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> for more information.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-stunts">Spellcasting Stunts</h5>
<p>You should consult the [Sorcerer Stunts], [Wizard Stunts], [Witch Stunts], [Druid Stunts], or [Cleric Stunts], class translation sections for ideas and a wide selection of relevant arcanist feats. However, the following feats are simple and possibly appealing to a mystical dabbler such as a bard.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Herbal Lore</strong>: Because I know the secrets of many plants, when I am Carefully Arcane I may create a potion, poultice, or poison using magics that are normally the domain of Primal, and I may add my Primal capability modifier (if any) as a bonus. Additionally, I can identify mundane poisons, provide simple remedies for headaches and minor mundane illnesses, embellish prepared food, and other such things when my herbal lore is relevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Scroll Scrivener</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of scribing scrolls, I can be Cleverly Arcane and prepare 'spell completion' items as scrolls or similar items for specific spell effects that I can cast. I can later cast the inscribed spell (using the simple magic system guidelines) from the item, gaining a bonus in the process. Other characters with Arcane +1 or better can also use my scrolls. I can also stockpile unused scrolls, as well as use scrolls inscribed by others. Unless explicitly denied means and opportunity, I can prepare a number of new scrolls ready for use equal to my Arcane capability each day.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-2">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="first-edition-add">First edition AD&amp;D</h4>
<p>Back in the days of first edition AD&amp;D, bards were basically what we would now think of as a &quot;prestige class&quot; for dual classed fighter / bards with unreasonably high (and randomly rolled!) characteristics across the board.</p>
<p>Further, when they finally got spell casting abilities their spells were druidic.</p>
<p>Celtic concepts of the bard as loremaster and mentor to heroes was the strongest fictional influence.</p>
<p>If you ever actually encountered a bard, they were most likely a higher leveled and very competent individual who was not to be underestimated or trifled with. Often they were agent provocateurs, or spies, or in positions of power as honored advisors to rulers.</p>
<h4 id="second-edition-add">Second edition AD&amp;D</h4>
<p>This edition normalized bards as a standard class, and presented them as a thief / wizard hybrid with some special sing-songy abilities, bardic lore, and a broad selection of weapon proficiencies.</p>
<p>Bards still required high stats to play, but not quite as badly as in 1e, and as a base class offering a sort of cherry picked assortment of the best features of three other classes it wasn't a bad way to go.</p>
<p>Further, thanks to the special quirkiness of this edition's asymmetrical experience points per level chart and the fact that bards used the fastest advancing track in the game (rogues), min maxing the bard's spellcasting to choose spells that got better based upon the caster's level allowed bards to be even more effective spell casters than an equivalently experienced wizard in certain situations.</p>
<p>And to top it off, some of the &quot;kits&quot; offered for bards were also pretty advantageous. It was a good time to be a bard.</p>
<p>When you met a bard, you were likely dealing with an effective &quot;gish&quot; character with a dangerously broad array of abilities who should not be underestimated.</p>
<h4 id="third-edition-dd">Third edition D&amp;D</h4>
<p>In this edition bards were presented as more of a magical minstrel know-it-all, emphasizing the bardic performance and lore elements of the concept.</p>
<p>Casting like sorcerers with a custom spell list of mixed quality (but perhaps in a nod to the 1e druidic bard, offering healing spells to an arcane caster), generally oriented towards buffing and team-support effects, and not really viable as backup martial characters past the lower levels due to base attack and hitpoint shortfalls.</p>
<p>Further, due to the changes in the skill system which allowed characters of all classes to be skilled in various things, aside from the wildcard of their special &quot;bardic lore&quot; ability, the skill element of the bard concept was also devalued.</p>
<p>And changes (for the better!) to multiclassing took away the special niche bards enjoyed in 2e as a hybrid collection of useful class features; jokes were famously made (such as Nale vs Elan in Order of the Stick) about playing a fighter / sorcerer / rogue instead of a bard.</p>
<p>Pathfinder revised the bard a bit, but the basic issues remained.</p>
<p>When you met a bard, you were likely dealing with an underpowered support character with weird quirks, and often portrayed (rightly or wrongly) as a buffoon or a fop.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-1">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>Perhaps more than any other class concept, the source materials' conception of the bard has changed quite a bit over the years, with each new edition of the rules presenting a significantly different take.</p>
<p>The underlying elements of the bard concept have generally included a martially competent, skilled, secondary spell caster.</p>
<p>Additional themes are a high degree of knowledge (or &quot;lore&quot;) in a variety of subjects, and a mystically powerful voice as evinced by entrancing music or oratory abilities.</p>
<p>The good news is, in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated you are free to express your character concept however you like, baring GM veto.</p>
<p>Don't feel obligated to don a straightjacket of slavish devotion to source material; you are free to be creative, assign your pluses, and define your character's Aspects and Stunts in a way that realizes <em>your</em> &quot;bard&quot; concept.</p>
<h2 id="the-cavalier">The Cavalier</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Cavalier class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social situations.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Paragon</strong>: Combative +4</p>
<p><strong>Well Drilled</strong>: Combative +3, Focused +1</p>
<p><strong>Courtier</strong>: Combative +3, Roguish +1</p>
</div>
<p>For purposes of Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, the differences between a fighter and a cavalier boils down to Stunt choices and wording of Aspects and Troubles to model a code of honor or equivalent to capture a &quot;cavalier&quot; feel.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended that players interested in making a cavalier type character refer to [the Fighter} class translation, and address their character's &quot;knightly order&quot; via careful selection of their Stunts and Aspects.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Syr/Syr.aspx">Syr</a> is a heavily armored Knight of the Blue Rose. The cavaliers of the Order of the Blue Rose dedicate themselves to promoting peace in the lands they roam. Skilled warriors and adept diplomats, these cavaliers counsel wisdom, patience, and understanding, but are ever mindful of the need to take up arms to strike down aggressors, tyrants, or evil usurpers. Although they believe wholeheartedly in peace as an aim and a final goal, cavaliers of the Blue Rose are warriors first, and embrace their role as guardians of those who cannot or will not take up arms to defend themselves.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-4">Stunts</h3>
<p>See <a href="#the-fighter">The Fighter</a> class translation for a selection of relevant warrior feats.</p>
<p>The following Stunts might be of interest to a cavalier.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Charger</strong>: Because I excel at charging into combat to deliver a devastating attack, I gain +3 while Forcefully or Quickly Combative to make melee attacks in a conflict if I first move one or more zones in the same action to reach my opponent. I cannot split my shifts between multiple opponents when I do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Courser</strong>: Because I am so skilled at fighting while mounted, I gain +2 when I am Quickly Combative and attack from the back of a mount.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Inspiring Leadership</strong>: Because I inspire my allies and followers, any allies who join me in battle gain +1 on all actions they take within a conflict while being Combative. Allies must be within three (3) zones and within line of sight of me to benefit from my leadership. This ability applies for the duration of the conflict even if I am taken out, as my allies are moved to protect or avenge me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mounted Strike</strong>: Because I excel at ride-by attacks when mounted, whenever I am Quickly Combative and attack after moving a zone, if I succeed with style my mount and I may immediately move 1 zone away as a free action. If I also choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to move an additional zone further away. I may also choose to spend a Fate point to move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rally Leader</strong>[:]{#ctl00_Content_RallyLeader_Line1} Because I am able to inspire my allies to regroup and rally, once per scene I can give a motivating monologue or shout out words of courage and valor to allow all allies within one (1) zone of me to clear one of their stress boxes or a Mild consequence.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="companions-1">Companions</h4>
<p>Cavaliers often have animal companions as mounts or followers such as squires and henchmen; see the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt options</a> section for details on how to incorporate companions into your character using Stunts.</p>

<h2 id="the-cleric">The Cleric</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Cleric class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants.</p>
<p>Their true strength lies in their ability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source.</p>
<p>In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. These emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods.</p>
<p>Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve.</p>
<p>The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-4">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Fervent</strong>: Divine +4</p>
<p><strong>Devout</strong>: Divine +3, Combative +1</p>
<p><strong>Militant</strong>: Divine +2, Combative +2</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-3">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>The only two Archetypes a cleric has to concern themselves with are <strong>Divine</strong> and <strong>Combatives</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +3 allows unrestricted spell casting using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guIdeliNes</a>, which you should read first if you are serious about playing a spellcaster. Also, some <a href="#sample-spells">sample spells</a> are available.</p>
<p>Thus if you want your starting cleric to be a full caster starting out but still be able to serve as a secondary combatant (matching the source material), you should consider the Devout set of Starting Archetypes, plus one or two combat related Stunts to shore up their &quot;warrior&quot; facet.</p>
<p>Starting clerics who prefer to accentuate their ability to fight should consider the Militant set of Starting Archetypes, plus one or two divine related Stunts to shore up their &quot;holy&quot; facet.</p>
<p>It's also possible to splash a Archetype other than <strong>Combative</strong> for priests of some divine patrons.</p>
<p>For instance the priest of a god of thieves might go <strong>Divine</strong> &amp; <strong>Roguish</strong>, while the priest of a god of strength and athleticism might go <strong>Divine</strong> &amp; <strong>Focused</strong> and the priest of a god of magic might go <strong>Divine</strong> &amp; <strong>Arcane</strong>.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Kurek/Kurek.aspx">Kurek</a> is a priest of the Dwarven god Trudd the Mighty, strongest of the Dwarven pantheon. Kurek is blessed by Trudd, and entered the priesthood young. He has since progressed far and seeks to spread his god's worship amongst the Dwarves of far Varisia.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, there's nothing preventing you from making a cleric that goes all in on the holiness facet, with <strong>Divine</strong> +4, such as demonstrated by the Fervent set of Starting Archetypes.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Uraska/Uraska.aspx">Uraska</a> is a strange man of progressing years, well favored in the service of Nethys and learned in the ways of mysticism. Despite his progressed years and appearance as a harmless mendicant priest, Uraska commands powerful divine forces granted to him by the literal god of Magic and Destruction; he is not to be trifled with.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="nature-priests">Nature Priests</h5>
<p>Nature priests of gods like <strong>Erastil</strong> and <strong>Gozreh</strong> are an odd breed, as in D&amp;D the difference between druids and priests who worship gods with nature related portfolios has always been an area where the class system shows its rough edges. But in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated terms a priest of a nature god can go <strong>Divine</strong> +1, <strong>Primal</strong> +3, which abstracts away from the problem.</p>
<p>This will allow your character to have appropriate levels of competence in natural settings. If you don't want your character's casting to suffer from having split Archetypes, you might also take a Stunt similar to <strong>Nature Priest</strong> but it isn't required.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Nature Priest</strong>: Because I worship a nature deity I am in tune with both divine and primal forces. When using Primal to work magic I may add my Divine capability as a bonus.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that while the concept of a vague &quot;green faith&quot; also exists in the source material <strong>Primal</strong> amply covers that idea on its own; <strong>Divine</strong> is not necessary.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Vadok/Vadok.aspx">Vadok</a> is a simple, earnest man dedicated to the service of the nature god <strong>Erastil</strong>, Old Deadeye. Also a skilled archer and accompanied by a powerful divinely invested puma named Aadat, Vadok is a erstwhile defender of common rustic folk and the ideal of man living in harmony with nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Nikade/Nikade.aspx">Nikade</a> is a confident and tempestuous young man dedicated to the service of the volatile nature god <strong>Gozreh</strong>, the master of Wind and Wave. Armed with a divinely invested harpoon, and capable of bending the very weather to his will when necessary, Nikade is a powerful exponent of his unpredictable patron's interests in the material world.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-3">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>A cleric's choice of Approaches will usually be influenced by their patron deity and the nature of their priesthood.</p>
<p>But stereotypically clerics are often <strong>Careful</strong> under ordinary circumstances, <strong>Forceful</strong> when smiting those who oppose their religion's goals, and <strong>Flashy</strong> when spouting litanies, prayers, and calls for divine aid.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-cleric-exactly">What Kind Of Cleric, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;cleric&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What deity does my cleric serve?</li>
<li>What role do I want my cleric to fill?</li>
<li>Does my cleric feel that they are only responsible for their own actions and have the ability to coexist with others who do not share their views, or do they hold those around them to the same code of conduct the cleric adheres to and persecute those who do not follow it?</li>
<li>Does my cleric focus more on spellcasting or on other abilities?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="whom-do-you-serve">Whom Do You Serve?</h4>
<p>The first question is probably the most important for framing the nature of your character. You can use the choice of divine patron to guide your decisions about your character's Aspects and Stunts, and to inform your portrayal.</p>
<h4 id="role">Role?</h4>
<p>Unlike some of the other class concepts coming from the source material, the cleric can be individualized to fill a variety of roles. Similarly, when you make a cleric character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, you get to decide what role you want your cleric to attempt to fill.</p>
<p>You might intend for your cleric to be a front line combatant, helping a group to succeed in conflicts. Or perhaps you want to play a &quot;face&quot; or leader cleric who takes point in social encounters. Or you might want your cleric to be a problem-solver or &quot;support&quot; character who is either specialized to address a particular niche or generalized to have a broad range of &quot;utility&quot; allowing them to adapt to emerging challenges that the group might face in their adventures. And of course, your cleric might attempt to fill more than one role or not be intentionally designed to fit any particular role as you prefer.</p>
<h4 id="contemplative-or-evangelist">Contemplative or Evangelist?</h4>
<p>Some clerics are portrayed as being inwardly focused, responsible for their own deeds and conduct. This sort of cleric can generally get along with others and cooperate towards a common goal with people of different viewpoints, at least to some extent. This is conducive to party dynamics and getting things done. However, it can also be quite dull.</p>
<p>Other clerics are portrayed as being outwardly focused, intent on imposing the worship of their religion and the tenets of their patron upon the world. This sort of cleric often has a difficult time working and playing well with others, and often finds themselves embroiled in some kind of strife due to their evangelical overtures and intolerance for other beliefs. This can make for some great drama, but on the other hand it can also get quite stale and annoying.</p>
<p>Regardless of where your cleric is at on that spectrum, thinking about it now will guide your choice of High Concept and Trouble. It will also indicate if you plan to portray the character in an antagonistic or cooperative manner relative to other player characters.</p>
<h4 id="dedicated-caster-or-all-arounder">Dedicated Caster or All-Arounder?</h4>
<p>If you intend for your cleric to be a dedicated caster of Divine spells, this will guide your selection of Archetype bonuses and possibly of one or more Stunts.</p>
<p>However if you want your character to have some of the stereotypical features of clerics in the source material, such as Channel Energy or Turn Undead, or you want to have a signature ability relevant to your cleric's patron deity, you'll need to allocate one or more Stunt slots to them.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Paryl/Paryl.aspx">Paryl</a> is a wandering priest greatly favored by Desna, goddess of Luck, Stars, Travel, and Dreams. On an endless journey, Paryl aids those met along the road, but his usually kind and generous nature turns hard and merciless when dealing with bandits or any who would interfere with the sanctity of traveling.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-5">Stunts</h3>
<p>Cleric characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#deific-stunts">Deific Stunts</a>, <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>a, <a href="#command-stunts">Command Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some clerics.</p>
<p>However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="faith-worthiness">Faith Worthiness</h4>
<p>Clerics that are granted abilities by their patrons can lose access to those abilities if they do something unworthy of their faith; thus such Stunts typically include language to that effect.</p>
<p>This is left to the GM's discretion, but it isn't intended to create antagonistic situations. Ultimately a player should have a large measure of control over their character's story; any failings of faith should be regarded as a roleplaying opportunity.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="holy-holy">Holy Holy</h4>
<p>Clerics are invested with divine power by their patron deities, though the nature of such favor varies from deity to deity, or even from individual to individual.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Detect Evil</strong>: Because I am sensitive to ethical and moral propensities, I am able to sense strong concentrations of immorality and evilness in individuals, objects, and areas from six (6) zones away even if the source in not detectable to my other senses. Additionally, I gain +2 to notice relevant concentrations of evil while Focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Aegis</strong>: Because my patron deity protects me I may use Divine to defend against non-Divine magical and unusual attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Favor</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against physical attacks, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Renewal</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, when I am Carefully Divine I may pray for aid to clear a stress box or a Mild Consequence, or to downgrade a Moderate or Severe Consequence, by overcoming a difficulty equal to the stress box's or Consequence's numerical value. This only works on my own stress and Consequences, not that of others. If I fail to overcome the difficulty I may not attempt to clear the same stress box or heal the same Consequence again; I must wait for it to clear by other means. I cannot use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Favored Follower</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, once per scene when I spend a fate point to get a reroll I may proceed as if I had rolled +2 on the dice instead of rolling a second time. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fervent Prayer</strong>: Because my faith is strong, I am sometimes especially blessed by my god. I may spend a Fate point to gain +2 Divine on one (1) action and pray for blessings appropriate to that level of Divine capability. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shield of Faith</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against indirect attacks such as poisons and strange abilities and magic, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>True Seeing</strong>: Because my patron diety grants me awareness, my powers of observation are divinely enhanced; I may use Divine instead of Focused to notice or perceive things, and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="defender-of-the-faith">Defender Of The Faith</h4>
<p>Many clerics are martially capable, able to serve as defenders of their faith and the faithful. Some rely purely on skill, while others benefit from blessings that aid them in battle.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combative Aegis</strong>: Because I have developed my defensive form to a high degree of skill, when I am Carefully Combative and appropriately equipped, if someone else in my zone is physically attacked I may defend on their behalf. However I take any shifts of damage that get past my defenses, rather than the intended target.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Damage Reduction</strong>: Because I am more durable than normal, I reduce by one (1) all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Weapon (-2)</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I have been graced with a divinely empowered weapon. If I have recently done something unworthy of my faith, the weapon loses its special abilities until I have atoned.</p>

<p><strong>Forbidding Presence</strong>: Because I present a very intimidating and stern visage while emanating a frightenting aura, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heavy Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear heavy armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am heavily armored.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Holy Hand Grenades</strong>: Because my patron favors me, I am able to craft special reliquaries containing holy power that are released upon impact when thrown, inflicting harm on evil outsiders, undead, and other unnatural creatures nearby. I cannot use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +1 to throw a holy hand grenade into my zone or an adjacent zone, generally against an Average (+1) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful, my holy hand grenade explodes and inflicts a number of shifts of damage equal to my (Careful + Divine) against every eligible target in the zone without splitting shifts between them. Malign outsiders (such as demons, devils, daemons, and proteans), undead, and other similar unnatural creatures are considered to be eligible for this effect.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of holy hand grenades equal to my (Careful + Divine). Other people can not use my holy hand grenades.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Divine +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Indomitable</strong>: Because I refuse to give in and I always vigorously protect myself, I get +1 when I am Forceful and defend if I am aware that I am in danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Inspiring Leadership</strong>: Because I inspire my allies and followers, any allies who join me in battle gain +1 on all actions they take within a conflict while being Combative.

This ability applies for the duration of the conflict even if I am taken out, as my allies are moved to protect or avenge me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Push Beyond The Edge</strong>: Because I fight to the bitter end no matter what the cost, at any time as a non action if my Severe consequence is currently clear I may choose to either worsen my Moderate consequence (if any) to a Severe consequence or take a new Severe consequence <strong>Pushed Myself Too Far</strong> to clear my Mild Consequences and all my Stress boxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rally Leader</strong>[:]{#ctl00_Content_RallyLeader_Line1} Because I am able to inspire my allies to regroup and rally, once per scene I can give a motivating monologue or shout out words of courage and valor to allow all allies within one (1) zone of me to clear one of their stress boxes or a Mild consequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Because of my impressive resilience, once per session if I would take a Consequence I may instead spend a Fate point.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Smite</strong>: Because I have been granted the ability to smite those who stand against me by my patron deity, I gain +1 while Combative to strike down a foe within my zone whose nature is anathemic to my patron deity; further if my attack inflicts a consequence I gain an additional free invoke on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Smite The Unworthy</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, when I am being Combative I may add my Divine capability to attack opponents who I know to be beyond redemption, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Weapon Mastery (-3)</strong>: Because I have spent many years mastering a type of weapon, I gain +1 to Combatives when I attack, defend, create advantage, or overcome while using any weapon of that type.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="suffer-not-the-undead">Suffer Not The Undead</h4>
<p>Some clerics of faiths that find the Undead to be particularly offensive abominations are graced with the ability to destroy or turn any Undead they may encounter.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Destroy Undead</strong>: Because I am particularly good at destroying lesser undead, while Flashily Divine I may overcome to destroy an Undead mook in my zone or an adjacent zone; the difficulty is equal to the number of hits the mook has remaining. This does work on mobs of nameless Undead mooks, but it does not work on significant NPC Undead that have consequences.</p>

<h4 id="option-prepared-casting">Option: Prepared Casting</h4>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows free casting by default, but some players might prefer their cleric to be a Prepared Caster; see <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> and <a href="#divine-prepared-caster">divine prepared caster</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-3">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="support-utility">Support / Utility</h4>
<p>The source material offers clerics as full casting support characters with an array of options including buffing, debuffing, status effect removal, and healing.</p>
<h4 id="secondary-tank-striker">Secondary Tank / Striker</h4>
<p>Additionally, a cleric can serve as a secondary tank and / or a secondary striker, and choice of deity and domains affords a good level of individualization.</p>
<h4 id="alignment-code-of-conduct">Alignment / Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>The primary downside of the cleric in the source material is alignment restrictions and a vague requirement to not fall from the faith of their chosen deity.</p>
<p>Generally this isn't as severe as a paladin's alignment and code of conduct, but it does impose some restrictions on a cleric's freedom of expression.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-2">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The cleric is a solid and flexible class in the source material, but Pathfinder Fate Accelerated offers even more flexibility to personalize your cleric to make a character that is as distinctive as they are capable.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated joyfully dispenses with the alignment concept altogether; &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;evilness&quot; and &quot;lawfulness&quot; and etc. can be a thing, but it is based upon interpretation of Aspects and deeds.</p>
<p>If you want to play a &quot;lawful good&quot; character and that means something to you personally, so be it.</p>
<p>Pick your character's High Concept, Trouble, and Aspects appropriately to further that ideal and then portray your character accordingly.</p>
<p>But there's no mechanical impact other than what is ordinarily available in Fate Accelerated.</p>
<p>Feel free to personalize your cleric to have abilities particularly suited to their deity's focus and fluff.</p>
<p>This will not only make your character more distinctive and memorable, it will also make the character's choice of deity matter more to the story.</p>
<p>The only limiter is whether the group or GM wants to maintain the arbitrary restrictions of the source material or not.</p>
<p>As a player interested in expressing their creativity you should first check with your GM to determine what they will and wont allow.</p>
<h2 id="the-druid">The Druid</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Druid class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, nature itself, spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who threaten them.</p>
<p>Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-5">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Primordial</strong>: Primal +4</p>
<p><strong>Untamed</strong>: Primal +3, Focused +1</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-4">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>The only Archetype a druid has to concern themselves with is <strong>Primal</strong> and everything else is optional.</p>
<p>To be considered a druid (and not some other hybrid concept), a character should start with at least <strong>Primal</strong> +3, which allows unrestricted spell casting using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guIdeliNes</a>, which you should read first if you are serious about playing a spellcaster. Also, write-ups for <a href="#sample-spells">sample spells</a> are available.</p>
<p>For a standard starting character, this leaves only the decision of where to put the final +1.</p>
<p>A hyper-specialized, dedicated druid will go all in on <strong>Primal</strong> +4, but putting a +1 into one of the other Archetypes goes a long way towards suggesting a more interesting background for the character. <strong>Focused</strong> is probably the most common secondary Archetype splash for druids.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> +1 is an excellent choice for a druid who is sharp of wit, physically fit, perceptive, and quick on their toes.</p>
<p><strong>Combative</strong> +1 is a good choice for a druid that prefers to use weapons rather than spells or shapeshifted teeth and claws to inflict harm.</p>
<p>In D&amp;D it is kind of a thing that druids tend to use scimitars, sickles, scythes...weapons with s's and c's in the name essentially; however you are free to ignore this trope if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> +1 is an unusual choice as there isn't much synergy between <strong>Roguish</strong> and <strong>Primal</strong>. However, there is the idea of a &quot;urban druid&quot; in the source material, and <strong>Roguish</strong> +1 and a Stunt or two can model that idea.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> +1 would be an extremely odd choice, most likely taken to anchor an unusual background concept. On the other hand, if you want to play a arcanist with a nature theme you might go the other way and consider something like a <a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Guidelines/Classes/Sorcerer.aspx#Verdant%20Bloodline">sorcerer with the verdant bloodline</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 is a complicated choice.</p>
<p>Nature priests of gods like <strong>Erastil</strong> and <strong>Gozreh</strong> are an odd breed, as in D&amp;D the difference between druids and priests who worship gods with nature related portfolios has always been an area where the class system shows its rough edges. But in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated terms a priest of a nature god can go <strong>Divine</strong> +1, <strong>Primal</strong> +3, which abstracts away from the problem.</p>
<p>This will allow your character to have appropriate levels of competence in natural settings. If you don't want your character's casting to suffer from having split Archetypes, you might also take a Stunt similar to <strong>Nature Priest</strong> but it isn't required.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Nature Priest</strong>: Because I worship a nature deity I am in tune with both divine and primal forces. When using Primal to work magic I may add my Divine capability as a bonus.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that while the concept of a vague &quot;green faith&quot; also exists in the source material <strong>Primal</strong> amply covers that idea on its own; <strong>Divine</strong> is not necessary.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Vadok/Vadok.aspx">Vadok</a> is a simple, earnest man dedicated to the service of the nature god <strong>Erastil</strong>, Old Deadeye. Also a skilled archer and accompanied by a powerful divinely invested puma named Aadat, Vadok is a erstwhile defender of common rustic folk and the ideal of man living in harmony with nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Nikade/Nikade.aspx">Nikade</a> is a confident and tempestuous young man dedicated to the service of the volatile nature god <strong>Gozreh</strong>, the master of Wind and Wave. Armed with a divinely invested harpoon, and capable of bending the very weather to his will when necessary, Nikade is a powerful exponent of his unpredictable patron's interests in the material world.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-4">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Druids are rarely <strong>Forceful</strong> or <strong>Flashy</strong>. Similarly, <strong>Quick</strong> is not a trait generally associated with druids, who tend towards ruminating, pondering, and waiting for auspicious moments to do things.</p>
<p>Druids are very often <strong>Careful</strong> in their wisdom, and mysteriously <strong>Sneaky</strong> when it comes to keeping secrets, tending hidden lore, reading forebodding signs, as well as more prosaically avoiding notice while moving around in the wildlands.</p>
<p>Many druids know a great deal about a lot of things and are <strong>Clever</strong> in their sagacity and disciplined thinking.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-druid-exactly">What Kind Of Druid, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;druid&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What form does my nature worship take; the &quot;green faith&quot;, animism, totemism, spiritualism, or something else?</li>
<li>Is maintaining balance between nature and civilization or between more metaphysical concepts of good, evil, law, and chaos an important facet of my druid?</li>
<li>Is changing forms into one or more animals an important facet of my druid?</li>
<li>Is my druid accompanied on their adventures by one or more exceptional animal companions?</li>
</ol>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="elements-hierarchy-balance">Elements, Hierarchy, Balance</h4>
<p>Some older versions of D&amp;D presented druids as having a strong connection with the <strong>Elemental Planes</strong> of Air, Earth, Fire, Water.</p>
<p>Also, some materials presented the concept of circles of druids with a strict hierarchical leadership working behind a veil of mystery to maintain the &quot;natural order&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; or neutrality between the moral and ethical poles.</p>
<p>Some players might want to incorporate one or both of these themes into their druid concepts.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="what-kind-of-nature-worship">What Kind Of Nature Worship?</h4>
<p>Determining your characters particular relationship with nature, their world view, and their belief system is probably the most important decision you will make during character creation.</p>
<p>Answering this question should impact your High Concept and probably your Trouble, at the very least, and might help inform your selection of other abilities.</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-a-balance">Maintaining A Balance?</h4>
<p>In some versions of the source material druids actively concern themselves with maintaining some kind of &quot;balance&quot;.</p>
<p>In some cases this is presented as the mundane balancing between unsullied nature and encroaching civilization. In other cases it is presented as a metaphysical balancing act between the moral and ethical poles of the D&amp;D alignment system and aligned material plane and extra-planar agents and exponents.</p>
<p>Deciding if you want to incorporate such ideas into your character will help guide your choice of Aspects, possibly one or more Stunts, and the portrayal of your druid character.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Iasa/Iasa.aspx">Iasa</a> is an ancient and aloof Elven deep wood druid, profoundly attuned to the natural order and his people's long history of living in balance with nature. Accompanied by his loyal ally, the kingly eagle Aarea, Iasa pursues some mysterious thread of fate.</p>
<p>Currently he seeks an ancient elven artifact, but what ultimate goal he labors towards remains a secret, like so many other mysteries Iasa chooses not to share.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="shapeshifter">Shapeshifter?</h4>
<p>If you want to incoporate changing into animal forms into your concept you'll need to reserve Stunt slots for a Stunt like Wild Shape. Due to the high opportunity cost involved, this decision will have a big impact on the final disposition of your character.</p>
<p>An alternative to dedicating Stunt slots to such an ability is to rely on spell casting rather than Stunts to accomplish shapeshifting. Though it will be slower and more awkward during play due to the loss of action efficiency caused by having to use Create Advantage frequently, from a character design standpoint there is no real opportunity cost involved if you go this route.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Lorisa/Lorisa.aspx">Lorisa</a> is a hardened near-savage Kellid from far Iobaria, gifted with the speech of beasts, and the ability to take on the forms of many animals.</p>
<p>She's as fearsome as an aggravated grizzly, and those who are wise avoid her clawed ire.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="animal-companions">Animal Companions?</h4>
<p>If you intend to incorporate one or more animal companions into your concept, you'll need to allocate one or more Stunt slots to it.</p>
<p>If you do have an animal companion it might be a specific mighty beast who is a significant NPC in their own right and an important part of your character, or it might just be the ability to summon or control indigenous mundane animals as needed.</p>
<h3 id="stunts-6">Stunts</h3>
<p>Druid characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#primordial-stunts">Primordial Stunts</a>, <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#elemental-stunts">Elemental Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some druids. However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="uncanny-animystic">Uncanny Animystic</h4>
<p>Most druids are deeply in touch with the natural world, and often have uncanny abilities that are more than mundane such as the ability to grow gills, sense danger, command undergrowth to ensnare the unwary, conjure an elemental weapons, or assume the forms of various animals.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Amphibious Swimmer</strong>: Because I am amphibious, I may add my Primal capability bonus when I am Focused while swimming. Additionally, while swimming underwater I can hold my breath for an entire scene before having to come up for air.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Blade Of Fire (-3)</strong>: Because of my elemental affinity I can conjure a flaming magical sword at will; I gain +1 to attack and defend and can use Primal in place of Combatives while wielding it. If I get a boost while attacking or defending with it, I may upgrade the boost to apply the Aspect On <strong>Fire!</strong> with two (2) invokes on it to the opponent I am engaged with.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Danger Sense</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +3 while Quickly Focused to notice things that are dangerous, fast moving, or pose an imminent threat to my safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Entangling Undergrowth</strong>: Because I am a master of natural magics, when I am in a rural area with vegetation, while I am Carefully Primal I may attempt to overcome a Great (+4) difficulty to cause the undergrowth in my zone or an adjacent zone to animate and wrap itself around and entangle all targets. See the Entangling Undergrowth profile for details. I am immune to this effect.</p>
<div class="description">

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hammer Of Stone (-3)</strong>: Because of my elemental affinity I can conjure a fearsome stone hammer at will; I gain +1 to attack and defend and can use Primal in place of Combatives while wielding it. If I get a boost while attacking or defending with it, I may upgrade the boost to apply the Aspect <strong>Stunned!</strong> with two (2) invokes on it to the opponent I am engaged with.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong>: Because I have natural weapons and am skilled in their use, I may use Focused instead of Combative when my natural weapons are relevant. In situations where it matters I can choose to be treated as attacking barehanded or attacking with a weapon, whichever benefits me more in the situation. Finally, though I can be inconvenienced and my natural weapons can be fouled or restrained, being disarmed is generally off the table for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pass Without Trace</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in the wildlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in wildland areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 2)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wild Shape (-2)</strong>:</p>
<p>Because I have the ability to change into the form of any normal animal of my choice, I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form.</p>
<p>When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). This lasts for an entire scene unless I choose to return to normal, which ends the effect. Additionally, I may spend another Fate point to assume a different animal's form, and I do not have to first change back to normal.</p>
<p>When I change forms I gain an additional Aspect named for the animal form I have assumed which I can invoke when my current animal form is relevant, and which can be compelled whenever my animal form or lack of humanoid anatomy might inconvenience me.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has natural weapons I may use Focused in place of Combatives while in a physical conflict.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="durable-survivor">Durable Survivor</h4>
<p>Many druids are unusually resilient survivors, capable of living through incredible trauma and harsh conditions.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Acid</strong>: Because I am immune to acid, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on acid.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Cold</strong>: Because I am immune to cold, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Fire</strong>: Because I am immune to fire, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Electricity</strong>: Because I am immune to electricity, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on electricity.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Mind-Affecting</strong>: Because I am immune to mind-affecting abilities, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on mental coersion or disorientation.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Poison</strong>: Because I am immune to poison, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on poison.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Living Off The Land</strong>: Because I am adept at surviving off of what nature offers me, I am always able to find enough food and water to keep myself and a couple of other people or animals healthy while in wildlands and rural areas (i.e. above ground and not near a city or town). Additionally if I've had at least half a day to become familiar with the terrain in a specific area of wilderness I gain +1 on all actions while being Primal. How large the area of wilderness might be is left to the GM's discretion, but it should be at least five square miles.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Reduction</strong>: Because I am significantly more rugged, robust, and survivable due to my deep connection with primal forces, I reduce by one (1) all physical stress inflicted on me, and I reduce by two (2) all environmental stress inflicted on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Resistance</strong>: Because my primal nature and elemental affinity protects me, I may use Primal to defend against non-Primal magical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Because of my impressive resilience, once per session if I would take a Consequence I may instead spend a Fate point.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="primal-hunter">Primal Hunter</h4>
<p>Many druids are masters of the natural world, supreme trackers and hunters, canny in their instincts, and feral in their ferocity.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Ambusher</strong>: Because I am great at setting up ambushes, I gain +1 when I Sneakily set up an ambush or create a related advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Foe Bane</strong>: Because I have a favored enemy Race, when I succesfully attack a target of that Race I inflict +2 shifts of extra stress. Additionally, if my attack results in a tie I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on the defender, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hunting Archer</strong>: Because I am a master archer and hunter, I may use Primal instead of Combative to attack with any kind of bow and arrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pounce!</strong>: Because I excel at leaping into combat in a startling burst of aggression, I gain +4 on my first attack in a conflict if I act first and can charge, lunge at, or pounce upon an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Pugilist</strong>: Because I am able to fight with my natural weapons and with feral intensity, I may use Primal instead of Focused when fighting barehanded or grappling.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Stalking Hunter</strong>: Because I am so good at stalking, hunting, and pouncing upon prey unnoticed, I get +2 when I am Sneakily Primal and create advantage or overcome challenges to set up and execute ambushes while in wildlands.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Strider</strong>: Because I am fleet of foot and able to move quickly, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an extra zone and I am unobstructed by foot hazards of less than knee height. If I am in a contest involving me walking rapidly or running, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Swamp Fighter</strong>: Because I am so adept at fighting within swampy areas and using my environment effectively, I may add Primal as a bonus when I am Combative in swamps and marshlands.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Swamp Stride</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in swamps and marshlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth and areas of water, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in swampy areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 3)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Tracker</strong>: Because I am so good at tracking a quary, I get +2 when I am Carefully Primal and create advantage or overcome challenges related to tracking things down in wilderness settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Urban Jungle</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of fading away, blending in, and avoiding notice even in urban areas among people, I can use Primal instead of Roguish to create advantage and overcome when attempting to avoid being noticed in civilized areas (Primal is already usable for this in rural, wildland areas).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wilderness Runner</strong>: Because I am so swift and able to run for hours, I may add my Primal capability bonus when I am Focused while running in wildlands.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wilderness Warrior</strong>: Because I am so adept at stalking prey and hunting in the wilderness, I may use Primal instead of Combative to attack when I am in the wilderness.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="companions-2">Companions</h4>
<p>Druids often have animal companions; see the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt options</a> section for details on how to incorporate companions into your character using Stunts.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Animal Companion (-3)</strong>: Because <strong>[describe the reason you have an animal companion]</strong>, I have attracted a powerful animal companion that chooses to aid me.</p>

<p>The ability to share the senses of an animal companion can be useful.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Companion's Senses</strong>: Because I share a mystical bond with my animal companion, I may spend a Fate point to share their senses for a scene at a range of a few dozen miles. This allows me to witness events through the senses of my companion as if I were present. This can be detected by others with appropriate senses as a Quick + Primal overcome action vs a Fantastic (+6) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="option-prepared-casting-1">Option: Prepared Casting</h4>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows free casting by default, but some players might prefer their cleric to be a Prepared Caster; see <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> and <a href="#primal-prepared-caster">primal prepared caster</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-4">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="support-utility-1">Support / Utility</h4>
<p>The source material offers druids as full casters with a spell list that isn't quite as good as the Arcane spell list, but still quite potent.</p>
<h4 id="self-buffing-strikers">Self-buffing Strikers</h4>
<p>Druids also get a grab bag of miscellaneous nature-themed abilities, including &quot;wild shape&quot;, which allows them to assume animal forms and then crush in melee combat as well as gaining other vicarious abilities.</p>
<h4 id="pets">Pets</h4>
<p>Additionally, druids often have one or more powerful animal companions, or have the ability to summon or control indigenous animals in whatever wildland they find themselves in.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-3">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>D&amp;D 3e recast druids as shapeshifters who assume the forms of animals and brawl, Beast Boy style.</p>
<p>Though conceptually this fits within the &quot;nature&quot; shtick of at least some druids, due to mechanical chicanery that is easily exploitable which allows druids to be unusually effective combatants, this mode of play has skewed the concept of druid away from &quot;nature magic user&quot; towards &quot;shapeshifter striker tank&quot;.</p>
<p>On the plus side, a class that was previously not played very often in earlier editions gained popularity commensurate with its perceived empowerment.</p>
<p>When making a druid character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, you are free to adhere to the Pathfinder / 3e version of the druid concept, or you can harken back to ealier versions from an edition of Advanced D&amp;D, or you can more loosely make whatever your idea of a druid might be.</p>
<p>A lot of design space fits nicely under the broad label of &quot;druid&quot;, and Pathfinder Fate Accelerated encourages you to explore it to find interesting character concepts.</p>
<h4 id="the-green-faith">The Green Faith</h4>
<p>In the world of Golarion, the <strong>Green Faith</strong> (also known as the Old Faith, the Great Eld, or the Wyrd) is a belief system based on the idea that natural forces are worthy of attention, respect, and veneration.</p>
<p>The Green Faith is more a philosophy than an outright religion; it is a way of viewing the world. The Green Faith can be found anywhere where nature still holds sway and has not yet succumbed completely to the ravages of civilization, whether it be deep forests, ocean coasts, searing deserts, or arctic tundra.</p>
<p>Followers of the Green Faith meditate daily, commune with natural forms of power, and show respect to nature in all things.</p>
<h4 id="druidism">Druidism</h4>
<p>Historically in our world, a Celtic druid was a member of the educated, professional class among the peoples of Gaul, Britain, Ireland, and possibly elsewhere during the Iron Age.</p>
<p>The druid caste included law-speakers, poets and doctors, among other learned professions, although the best known among the druids were the religious leaders.</p>
<p>It is thought that the core of druidism was a deep-seated belief in reincarnation; not just in the transmigration of the soul from one human form to another, but to other life forms as well. This belief in reincarnation is sometimes credited as a contributing factor to the druidic penchant for blood sacrifices. ]</p>
<h4 id="animism">Animism</h4>
<p>Animism (from Latin animus, -i &quot;soul, life&quot;) is the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena) possess a spiritual essence.</p>
<p>Animism encompasses the belief that there is no separation between the spiritual and physical (or material) world, and souls or spirits exist, not only in humans, but also in some other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers, or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind, and shadows.</p>
<h4 id="totemism">Totemism</h4>
<p>Totemism is a system of belief in which each human is thought to have a spiritual connection or a kinship with the essence of another being such as an animal or plant, often called a &quot;spirit-being&quot; or &quot;totem.&quot;</p>
<p>The totem is thought to interact with a given group or an individual and to serve as their emblem or symbol, offering protection, and confering some measure of the totem's perceived attributes upon the chosen recipients.</p>
<h4 id="shamanism">Shamanism</h4>
<p>Shamanism is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to encounter and interact with a spirit world and channel transcendental energies or spirits into this world.</p>
<p>A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.</p>
<p>Shamans gain knowledge and the power to heal by entering into a spiritual world or a similar &quot;other&quot; dimension.</p>
<p>Most shamans have dreams or visions that tell them certain things. The shaman may have or acquire many spirit guides, who often guide and direct the shaman in their travels in the spirit world.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Nevaren/Nevaren.aspx">Nevaren</a> is a wild eyed and menacing master of the raven mysteries, able to call all ravens and crows in his vicinity and bind the murder to his will.</p>
<p>A follower of the ancient Shoanti traditions of totemic animism, Nevaren is a powerful shaman and wise man.</p>
<p>Attuned to the natural world and privvy to many secrets revealed by the totem of the crafty Raven, he knows far more than he ever reveals.</p>

<h2 id="the-fighter">The Fighter</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Fighter class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Fighters excel at combat---defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-6">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Weaponmaster</strong>: Combative +4</p>
<p><strong>Hero</strong>: Combative +3, Focused +1</p>
<p><strong>Wily Warrior</strong>: Combative +3, Roguish +1</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-5">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>The only Archetype a fighter has to concern themselves with is <strong>Combatives</strong>; everything else is optional. To be considered a fighter (and not some other hybrid concept), a character should start with at least <strong>Combatives</strong> +3.</p>
<p>For a standard starting character, this leaves only the decision of where to put the final +1.</p>
<p>A hyper-specialized, dedicated fighter will go all in on <strong>Combatives</strong> +4, but putting a +1 into one of the other Archetypes goes a long way towards suggesting a more interesting background for the character. <strong>Focused</strong> is probably the most common secondary Archetype splash for fighters, and <strong>Roguish</strong> is a close second.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> +1 is a very solid and safe choice for a fighter who is sharp of wit, physically fit, perceptive, and quick on their toes.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> +1 is a great choice for a street savvy fighter who lives in a big city or that can benefit from some people skills.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> +1 is a reasonable choice for a fighter originating from a remote outpost or trained as a scout or who grew up in the country before becoming a soldier. However care should be taken to not veer over into more of a ranger.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> +1 is a more fringe choice but could make sense for a fighter who was well educated at a university and studied magical theory (arcana), or dead languages, or other esoteric subjects as a scholastic exercise.</p>
<p>It would also make sense for a fighter who once worked as a guard for a magic oriented individual or organization.</p>
<p>Dabbling in Arcane now at the &quot;basic knowledge&quot; level also opens the door to later progression as a spell sword or magus.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that a Archetype can always defend against itself; thus a fighter with Arcane +1 effectively has an &quot;improved save&quot; vs arcane magic.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 is perhaps the most unusual choice but not inappropriate for a fighter who gained his education from a priest or a learning institution affiliated with an organized church. Even if the fighter is not a devout follower of some deity and does not intend to become a paladin or war priest, knowledge of the forces of good and evil or of cosmological concerns or of church politics might come in handy at some point.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-5">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Fighters are often <strong>Careful</strong> and rarely <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p>Many, perhaps most, fighters are <strong>Forceful</strong>, but some more flamboyant fighters trend towards <strong>Flashy</strong>. And many fighters are often passably <strong>Quick</strong> with a blade, as it can often mean the difference in which side of a fight draws first blood.</p>
<p>Most fighters, the rank and file, meat-shields, grunts, and the like, have no need to be <strong>Clever</strong>; but there are educated and intelligent men and women who follow the way of the blade...officers, leaders, tacticians, champions...and they can be quite erudite and sharp of wit.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-fighter-exactly">What Kind Of Fighter, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;fighter&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is my character more of a natural talent or are they the product of a training program?</li>
<li>Is my character more of a brute force fighter or a finesse fighter?</li>
<li>Is my character more of a any weapon will do sort or a master of a specific weapon?</li>
<li>Is my character more of a heavily armored tank or a lightly armored skirmisher?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="self-taught-or-trained">Self-taught or Trained?</h4>
<p>How did your character became a fighter? Did they just pick up a sword, toss on a chain shirt, and proceed to figure it out as they went? Were they mentored by an older fighter? Or were they accepted or forced into formal instruction such as in an army training program? And so on.</p>
<h4 id="brute-force-or-finesse">Brute Force or Finesse?</h4>
<p>Some fighters rely on strength and power, others on speed and precision, and others are somewhere in between. Deciding where your Fighter falls on this spectrum will help you choose your Approaches at a minimum; a brute force fighter will tend to favor <strong>Forceful</strong> or <strong>Flashy</strong>, while a more finesseful fighter will tend towards <strong>Quick</strong> and / or <strong>Clever</strong>, and a more defensive fighter will tend towards <strong>Careful</strong>.</p>
<p>It will also probably be reflected in at least one of your Aspects, and possibly a Stunt.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Hessia/Hessia.aspx">Hessia</a> is a heavily armored but aggressive fighter who likes to strike first, strike hardest, and strike last. Used to dirty fights, she wears spiked armor that quickly dissuades anyone trying to grapple her, and her fearsome demeanor can set the knees of her enemies to quaking. Press ganged and trained to serve in the now fallen order of the Grey Maidens, Hessia has added a collection of rough and ready dirty tricks, low blows, and vicious hackery to her original training. Hessia prefers the longsword, but she's skilled in all variety of standard weaponry.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="weapon-specialist-or-all-arounder">Weapon Specialist or All-Arounder?</h4>
<p>As weapons are just trappings in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, with no special intrinsic benefits, deciding what sort of weapons your fighter prefers is ostensibly a fluff question, primarily influencing cosmetic details and portrayal. But if you really want your fighter to be a weapon specialist vs a generalist, you'll want to incorporate the idea into at least one of your Aspects and / or at least one of your Stunts.</p>
<p>The main benefit to incorporating a preferred weapon into your character's concept is that it can become a focal point for the character and help anchor the persona in people's minds. Generic Fighter Guy is boring and thus forgetable, but &quot;Renaldo...master of the twirling hand axes!&quot;, will tend to stand out a little more.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Farwyn/Farwyn.aspx">Farwyn</a> is a no nonsense fighter capable of laying waste to all who come near him. Drilled and honed into a warrior for many years by a famous champion, he now seeks fame and fortune in the harsh crucible of combat.</p>
<p>Farwyn's weapon of choice is the glaive, and he excels at striking down all who stand against him in a whirlwind of precise violence.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="heavily-armored-or-lightly-nimble">Heavily Armored or Lightly Nimble?</h4>
<p>Some fighters pile on the armor, while others prefer to stay light on their feet. Similar to choosing your preferred weapons, as armor is just a trapping in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated with no special intrinsic benefits the decision doesn't matter mechanically.</p>
<p>However your character's choice of armor might say something about their personality and feelings about risk vs. reward. For instance does your heavily armored fighter wear so much steel because they are conservative and risk-averse, or do they throw themselves into the thickest part of the fray with confidence in their metal shell's ability to protect them from harm?</p>
<p>Does your lightly armored swordsman dart and circle around the edges of a conflict looking for the best place to strike, or do they dance through the melee with graceful lethality confident of their ability to block and evade their foes' clumsy attacks?</p>
<p>Thinking about these sorts of things will affect your portrayal at a minimum, and might influence your Aspects and Stunts.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Dwyth/Dwyth.aspx">Dwyth</a> is a sturdy defense oriented heavily armored fighter, able to turn a momentary success in battle into a lasting defensive edge, and to see a hard fight through to the bitter end. Trained as a Dwarven Armorine in his youth, Dwyth did his time as a solider, then as a mercenary, and most recently as a bounty hunter, but the iron discipline drilled into him years ago holds true. Dwyth prefers his Dwarven Axe, but he'll kill with whatever is handy.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-7">Stunts</h3>
<p>Fighter characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>, <a href="#competence-stunts">Competence Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some fighters. However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="defensive">Defensive</h4>
<p>Fighters that intend to live another day typically develop their defensive options.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Canny Guard</strong>: Because of my skill and experience as a warrior it is difficult to catch me off guard. When I am defending against physical attacks and tie, my opponent does not get a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combative Aegis</strong>: Because I have developed my defensive form to a high degree of skill, when I am Carefully Combative and appropriately equipped, if someone else in my zone is physically attacked I may defend on their behalf. However I take any shifts of damage that get past my defenses, rather than the intended target.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Defensive Posture</strong>: Because I am trained in a defensive fighting style, if I get a boost when I am Carefully Combative while attacking I may use it to create the situational Aspect <strong>Defensive Posture</strong> on myself with two (2) invokes.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heavy Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear heavy armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am heavily armored.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Improved Disarm</strong>: Because I like to disarm others, I get +1 when I am Quick and attempt to create advantage to attach the situational Aspect <strong>Disarmed</strong> to other people who weild weapons.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Indomitable</strong>: Because I refuse to give in and I always vigorously protect myself, I get +1 when I am Forceful and defend if I am aware that I am in danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Just Roll With It</strong>: Because I excel at avoiding harm and rolling with whatever comes my way, I can use more than one stress box to absorb stress from an attack (normally, only one stress box may be used to offset stress from a single attack).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Light Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear light armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am lightly armored.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Medium Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear medium armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am appropriately armored.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Because of my impressive resilience, once per session if I would take a Consequence I may instead spend a Fate point.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Stalwart Resistance</strong>: Because my innate fortitude and intrinsic vitality protects me, I gain +1 to defend against magical and unusual attacks without needing special narrative justification or first creating an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="offensive">Offensive</h4>
<p>A fighter that never goes on the offensive would be a strange duck. Most fighters have one or more techniques for making foes sorry to have crossed their path.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Acrobatic Fighting</strong>: Because I am excellent at acrobatically flipping around and tumbling to good advantage while in combat, when I am engaged in a conflict I may add my Focused bonus to Combatives when I am able to make my acrobatics relevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Aggressive Assault</strong>: Because I am driven to extreme aggression, when I am Forcefully Combative and attack I may add from one to four additional Fate dice to my 4dF attack roll and choose the four best dice as my result. However, until my next exchange whenever I defend I add the same number of Fate dice to my defend rolls and choose the four worst dice as my result.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Barehanded Fighting</strong>: Because my fighting skills include barehanded combat, I may use Combative instead of Focused when fighting barehanded or grappling.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bums Rush</strong>: Because I like to overwhelm others, I get +2 when I am Forceful and attempt to tackle or bowl over an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combat Veteran</strong>: Because I have engaged in so much combat, I gain +1 when I am Combative and attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combat Veteran (-2)</strong>: Because I have engaged in so much combat, I gain +1 when I am Combative and attack or defend.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Forbidding Presence</strong>: Because I present a very intimidating and stern visage while emanating a frightenting aura, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Forcefully Aggressive</strong>: Because I am so physically powerful, I get +1 when I am Forceful and attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Lightning Draw</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of the lightning draw, I gain an automatic boost when I am Quick and draw my blade for the first time in an exchange. Additionally, if I opt to do this at the beginning of a conflict I gain +2 to determine who goes first.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Making It Count</strong>: Because I am able to make my attacks really matter, on an attack that succeeds with style I may spend a fate point to prevent the target from checking a stress box to reduce the stress of the attack. The target may still take consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Passing Strike</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quickly Combative and attack, if I choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move one (1) zone away, as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pounce!</strong>: Because I excel at leaping into combat in a startling burst of aggression, I gain +4 on my first attack in a conflict if I act first and can charge, lunge at, or pounce upon an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Powerful Attack</strong>: Because I am so skilled at delivering forceful attacks, I gain +2 when I am Forcefully Combative and attack while armed with a weapon.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Two Weapon Fighting (-2)</strong>: Because I am so skilled at dual-wielding two weapons, I gain +1 when I am Combative and attack or defend while armed appropriately. Additionally if I make a physical attack while armed appropriately and split shifts between exactly two opponents, I inflict +1 shift of additional damage to each target.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Quick Strike</strong>: Because I am fast and accurate, I get +3 when I am Quickly Combative and attack an opponent that has not yet gone in this exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Weapon Mastery (-3)</strong>: Because I have spent many years mastering a type of weapon, I gain +1 to Combatives when I attack, defend, create advantage, or overcome while using any weapon of that type.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="multi-attacker">Multi-attacker</h4>
<p>Some fighters are so skilled at laying about themselves with lethal force that they may simultaneously engage multiple opponents in their vicinity.</p>
<p>This sort of ability can take many forms to suit an individual character's style. The below example of Whirlwind Attack is provided to illustrate how such a Stunt can be structured to allow a fighter to do this more than once per session by committing more than one Stunt slot to the ability; this might be done at character creation or over time as a character progresses.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Whirlwind Attack</strong>: Because I am a potent warrior once per session when I am Flashily Combative and attack with a suitable weapon, I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Whirlwind Attack (-2)</strong>: Because I am a potent warrior once per scene when I am Flashily Combative and attack with a suitable weapon, I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Whirlwind Attack (-3)</strong>: Because I am a potent warrior, when I am Flashily Combative and attack with a suitable weapon I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them. However if I use this ability more than once per conflict I take a cumulative -1 penalty to my 4dF attack roll for each time I've previously used the ability in the current conflict.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-5">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="strikers">Strikers</h4>
<p>They fight, they fight. Fighty fight fight.</p>
<p>It's relatively uninspiring and no-frills, but regardless of the straightforwardness of it Fighters are the defacto vanilla full martial melee class in the source material.</p>
<p>The source material offers fighters as dedicated combat focused characters who learn how to hit more and harder as well as gaining a lot of feats as they level up.</p>
<h4 id="tanks">Tanks</h4>
<p>Fighters learn to make better use of armor and get tougher as they level up, and are able to serve as damage sponges for a party of adventurers..</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-4">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The source material has an unfortunate tendency to reduce Fighters to little more than weapon and armor platforms, with combat maneuvers as icing, leaving a player to manufacture their own &quot;flavor&quot; with little support from the mechanics beyond whatever can be pieced together with feat chains and &quot;archetypes&quot; (as defined in the Pathfinder rule books).</p>
<p>The good news is that in <strong>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated this is not the case</strong>; warriors gain a huge uplift both in richness of concept and in a more even footing with casters thanks in part to the elegant design of the Fate system, and due to the possibilities of the create advantage action in particular.</p>
<p>So, just imagine the bold warrior you always wanted to play, and pick Aspects and Stunts accordingly. Hopefully you will be impressed with how interesting and dynamic the resulting character turns out to be.</p>
<h2 id="the-inquisitor">The Inquisitor</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Inquisitor class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough.</p>
<p>Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals.</p>
<p>Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing down enemies and researching emerging threats. As a result, they often travel with others, if for no other reason than to mask their presence. Inquisitors work with members of their faith whenever possible, but even such allies are not above suspicion.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Worldly</strong>: Divine +1, Roguish +3</p>
<p><strong>Adaptable</strong>: Divine +1, Roguish +2, Combative +1</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-6">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>The only two Archetypes an inquisitor has to concern themselves with are <strong>Roguish</strong> and <strong>Divine</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +3 allows unrestricted spell casting using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guIdeliNes</a>, which you should read first if you are serious about playing a spellcaster. Also, write-ups for <a href="#sample-spells">sample spells</a> are available.</p>
<p>Thus if you want your starting inquisitor to be a full caster starting out, you should consider the Fanatical set of Starting Archetypes, plus one or two practical Stunts to shore up the practical facet of an inquisitor.</p>
<p>Starting inquisitors who prefer to accentuate their practical side should consider the Pragmatic or Worldly sets of Starting Archetypes, plus one or two faith related Stunts to shore up their &quot;holy&quot; facet.</p>
<h4 id="freestyle">Freestyle</h4>
<p>It's also possible to make a character that is conceptually an inquisitor but mechanically defined with a Archetype other than <strong>Roguish</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance the inquisitor of a god that deals in fundamental forces might go with <strong>Divine</strong> &amp; <strong>Primal</strong>, while the inquisitor of a god of art and creativity might go <strong>Divine</strong> &amp; <strong>Focused</strong> and the inquisitor of a god of magic might go <strong>Divine</strong> &amp; <strong>Arcane</strong>.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Thuvor/Thuvor.aspx">Thuvor</a> serves the interests of Pharasma, The Lady of Graves, goddess of birth, death, and prophesy.</p>
<p>A powerful demiurge, a master of both Theurgy and Anatheurgy, Thuvor commands the fundamental forces of positive and negative energy. Additionally, he is particularly adept at destroying the undead, which are an abomination before Pharasma.</p>
<p>Greatly favored by his patron deity, Thuvor is engaged by his Lady primarily to hunt down and deal with those trafficing in souls, to oppose particularly egregious uses of necromancy, and to neutralize overreaching intelligent undead who are disrupting the cycle of life and death (such as an ambitious vampire lord).</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Skoth/Skoth.aspx">Skoth</a> is a servant of the god of magic Nethys, The All-Seeing Eye, dedicated to self-mastery of the disparate arts of magic and swordsmanship. He is big on being mysterious, tries to cloak the full range of his abilities as a surprise for the unwary, and keeps his own counsel.</p>
<p>In the service of Nethys, Skoth is a seeker of powerful magical artifacts that have been lost to the world as a sort of arcano-archaeologist.</p>
<p>Researching lost relics, and then questing to recover any that seem likely, he sometimes receives visions from his god pointing him in the right direction.</p>
<p>Woe be unto any would-be treasure hunters who seek the same prize...</p>
</div>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-6">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>An inquisitor's choice of Approaches will usually be influenced by their patron deity and the nature of their service to the religion associated with that deity.</p>
<p>But stereotypically inquisitors are often <strong>Sneaky</strong>, <strong>Clever</strong>, and <strong>Careful</strong> during an investigation, but then <strong>Forceful</strong> or <strong>Flashy</strong> when persecuting a heretic or otherwise laying down their divine judgment.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-inquisitor-exactly">What Kind Of Inquisitor, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;inquisitor&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What deity does my inquisitor serve?</li>
<li>Does my inquisitor feel that they are only responsible for their own actions and have the ability to coexist with others who do not share their views, or do they hold those around them to the same code of conduct the inquisitor adheres to and persecute those who do not follow it?</li>
<li>Does my inquisitor focus more on their divine or their roguish abilities?</li>
<li>Is my inquisitor any good in a conflict, and if so how?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="whom-do-you-serve-1">Whom Do You Serve?</h4>
<p>The first question is probably the most important for framing the nature of your character. You can use the choice of divine patron to guide your decisions about your character's Aspects and Stunts, and to inform your portrayal.</p>
<h4 id="contemplative-or-evangelist-1">Contemplative or Evangelist?</h4>
<p>Some inquisitors are portrayed as being inwardly focused, responsible for their own deeds and conduct. In fact, some inquisitors conceal their deific nature altogether, never mentioning their allegiance to their deity or religion.</p>
<p>This sort of inquisitor can generally get along with others and cooperate towards a common goal with people of different viewpoints, at least to some extent. This is conducive to party dynamics and getting things done.</p>
<p>Other inquisitors are portrayed as being outwardly focused, intent on imposing the worship of their religion and the tenets of their patron upon the world. This sort of inquisitor often has a difficult time working and playing well with others, and often finds themselves embroiled in some kind of strife due to their evangelical overtures and intolerance for other beliefs. This can make for some great drama, but on the other hand it can also get quite stale and annoying.</p>
<p>Regardless of where your inquisitor is at on that spectrum, thinking about it now will guide your choice of High Concept and Trouble. It will also indicate if you plan to portray the character in an antagonistic or cooperative manner relative to other player characters.</p>
<h4 id="divine-or-roguish-dominant">Divine or Roguish Dominant?</h4>
<p>Some inquisitors concentrate on their ability to get things done via practical skills, while others favor deific pursuits. Obviously, where your inquisitor sits on this spectrum will guide your decision on how to assign your Archetype bonuses.</p>
<p>Secondarily, this question also covers consideration of whether or not you want your inquisitor to start out with full spellcasting ability.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Ephraim/Ephraim.aspx">Ephraim</a> is a kind and wise servant of Sarenrae, dedicated to reducing discord in the world and furthering the growth of his religion. Quick with a kind word and perhaps a small trinket picked up along the way on his long travels, he has an uncanny ability to smooth relations even between people of diverse viewpoints.</p>
<p>Also skilled at trading and bartering, he maintains enough of a sideline in curios to fund his wanderings as well as give him a handy pretense of commerce when traveling in more policed regions.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="fight-or-flight">Fight or Flight?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, conflict is inevitable. Inquisitors are not primarily oriented around combat, but that doesn't mean that they cannot make their presense felt when things get ugly.</p>
<p>By itself <strong>Roguish</strong> can be used to attack others and defend against attacks with a bit of narrative justification, typically using light weapons such as daggers and short swords, throwing knives, crossbows, and similar &quot;practical&quot; weapons.</p>
<p>A character using <strong>Roguish</strong> to participate in melee combat avoids straight toe-to-toe engagements and instead fights cagey or &quot;dirty&quot;, using the environment and surprise to their advantage. If at all possible most rogues forced to do violence prefer to end the fight quickly with a sneak attack or ambush, because they know that the longer the conflict plays out the more likely they'll get cornered or whacked.</p>
<p>In a prolonged melee fight against an opponent using <strong>Combatives</strong>, the longer the fight goes on the more difficult it will typically get for the rogue to keep coming up with justifications for attacking and defending while being <strong>Roguish</strong>. The nature of the scene set up and clever usage of the create advantage action will determine how easy it is to keep flogging the narrative for justifications, but simple action economy favors an equivalently experienced foe using <strong>Combatives</strong> and the rogue is definitely on a clock.</p>
<p>Fortunately it is relatively easy to level the playing field between <strong>Combatives</strong> and <strong>Roguish</strong> with one or more Stunts such as the following.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dirty Infighter</strong>: Because I am skilled at dirty tricks fighting and getting inside my opponents' guard to strike at vulnerable areas, I am a surprisingly effective combatant. Though my fighting style remains unconventional and evasive, when armed with daggers, light one handed melee weapons such as short swords, garrottes, saps, makeshift weapons, and similar armaments I can use Roguish to directly engage opponents who are using Combative in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shiv</strong>: Because I am skilled with daggers of all shapes and sizes, I may use Roguish as if it were Combatives when fighting with one or more daggers in a conflict, and I inflict +1 stress when I successfully attack while doing so.</p>
</div>
<p>Alternately, an inquisitor with <strong>Divine</strong> +3 or higher can use offensive spells as their contribution to a conflict.</p>
<p>Ultimately you'll need to decide for yourself if your inquisitor chooses to avoid conflicts or is otherwise dead weight in a fight, or not, and allocate your Stunts and Archetypes appropriately.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Doritha/Doritha.aspx">Doritha</a> is a deadly Justiciar, lethal with sword and crossbow, unrelenting in the pursuit and persecution of oathbreakers and theives foolish enough to steal from a Temple of Abadar.</p>
<p>Few have ever evaded her judgment, and many have fallen to her blade or been slain by her crossbow bolts. Any transgressors unfortunate enough to have her upon their trail are likely not long for this world.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-8">Stunts</h3>
<p>Inquisitor characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#deific-stunts">Deific Stunts</a>, <a href="#dastardly-stunts">Dastardly Stunts</a>, <a href="#archer-stunts">Archer Stunts</a>, <a href="#social-stunts">Social Stunts</a>, <a href="#competence-stunts">Competence Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some inquisitors.</p>
<p>However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="faith-worthiness-1">Faith Worthiness</h4>
<p>Inquisitors that are granted abilities by their patrons can lose access to those abilities if they do something unworthy of their faith; thus such Stunts typically include language to that effect.</p>
<p>This is left to the GM's discretion, but it isn't intended to create antagonistic situations. Ultimately a player should have a large measure of control over their character's story; any failings of faith should be regarded as a roleplaying opportunity.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="dangerous">Dangerous</h4>
<p>Inquisitors are often surprisingly dangerous opponents.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Back At You</strong>: Because even my defense is dangerous, whenever I am Quickly Roguish and defend with style against a physical melee attack while wielding a light weapon I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on my attacker, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Careful Crossbowman</strong>: Because I am skilled with a crossbow, I gain +2 when I am Carefully Roguish and attack with a crossbow.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dirty Infighter</strong>: Because I am skilled at dirty tricks fighting and getting inside my opponents' guard to strike at vulnerable areas, I am a surprisingly effective combatant. Though my fighting style remains unconventional and evasive, when armed with daggers, light one handed melee weapons such as short swords, garrottes, saps, makeshift weapons, and similar armaments I can use Roguish to directly engage opponents who are using Combative in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Weapon (-2)</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I have been graced with a divinely empowered weapon. If I have recently done something unworthy of my faith, the weapon loses its special abilities until I have atoned.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="divine-weapon-1">Divine Weapon</h6>

<p>See [Special Items] for details.</p>
<p>This item requires Divine +2 or better to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Foe Bane</strong>: Because I have a favored enemy Race, when I succesfully attack a target of that Race I inflict +2 shifts of extra stress. Additionally, if my attack results in a tie I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on the defender, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Forbidding Presence</strong>: Because I present a very intimidating and stern visage while emanating a frightenting aura, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hip Shot</strong>: Because I am skilled at rapidly shooting arrows, I gain +2 when I am Quickly Roguish and attack with a short bow or hand crossbow.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Making It Count</strong>: Because I am able to make my attacks really matter, on an attack that succeeds with style I may spend a fate point to prevent the target from checking a stress box to reduce the stress of the attack. The target may still take consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mobile Strike</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quickly Roguish and attack, if I succeed with style and choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move 1 zone away, as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>One Against Many</strong>: Because I am skilled at defending myself against multiple attackers, I gain +2 to defend when I fight alone against two or more opponents. A single mook defined as a mob counts as being multiple opponents for purposes of this ability as long as there are two or more 'individuals' within the mob. 'Fighting alone' in this context means no allies are in my zone or an adjacent zone, and no ally is aiding me or attacking my opponents.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Retribution</strong>: Because my retribution is terrible when I succesfully attack an opponent who has inflicted stress or consequences upon me in the current conflict I inflict +1 shift more damage and this damage cannot be reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sneak Attack</strong>: Because I am good at looking unremarkable or going unnoticed altogether only to launch a deadly and treacherous attack on the unwary, I may add +4 when I am Sneakily Roguish and attack by surprise. If I inflict a Mild or Moderate consequence on my opponent with this attack I may spend a Fate point to bump the consequence from Mild to Moderate or from Moderate to Severe.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sudden Attack</strong>: Because I am prone to sudden violence, I get +2 when I Forcefully attack an opponent who is unaware of my intent.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="durable">Durable</h4>
<p>Many inquisitors are unusually resilient or difficult to injure.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Close Call</strong>: Because I excel at getting out of really bad situations, I can spend a fate point to concede after I already rolled to defend (normally a concession must be made instead of rolling to defend).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Aegis</strong>: Because my patron deity protects me I may use Divine to defend against non-Divine magical and unusual attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Favor</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against physical attacks, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Renewal</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, when I am Carefully Divine I may pray for aid to clear a stress box or a Mild Consequence, or to downgrade a Moderate or Severe Consequence, by overcoming a difficulty equal to the stress box's or Consequence's numerical value. This only works on my own stress and Consequences, not that of others. If I fail to overcome the difficulty I may not attempt to clear the same stress box or heal the same Consequence again; I must wait for it to clear by other means. I cannot use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Favored Follower</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, once per scene when I spend a fate point to get a reroll I may proceed as if I had rolled +2 on the dice instead of rolling a second time. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rogue's Reflexes</strong>: Because I have great reflexes and am able to evade harm better than most people, I may use Roguish to defend against any kind of indirect or surprise attack and to avoid harm by getting out of the way of it. Narratively this can take many forms, such as rolling out of the way, ducking behind cover, 'seeing it coming' and somehow interupting the attack, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Roguish +2 to use.</p>
<p>NOTE: Roguish +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Roguish +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shield of Faith</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against indirect attacks such as poisons and strange abilities and magic, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Stalwart Resistance</strong>: Because my innate fortitude and intrinsic vitality protects me, I gain +1 to defend against magical and unusual attacks without needing special narrative justification or first creating an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="perceptive">Perceptive</h4>
<p>Many inquisitors are perceptive, alert, mystically aware, or difficult to fool or evade.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Danger Sense</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +3 while Quickly Focused to notice things that are dangerous, fast moving, or pose an imminent threat to my safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Detect Evil</strong>: Because I am sensitive to ethical and moral propensities, I am able to sense strong concentrations of immorality and evilness in individuals, objects, and areas from six (6) zones away even if the source in not detectable to my other senses. Additionally, I gain +2 to notice relevant concentrations of evil while Focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Manhunter</strong>: Because I am skilled at tracking a quary, I can use Roguish instead of Primal when tracking a sentient humanoid in any environment, and I gain +1 when I Roguishly overcome challenges when doing so in an urban environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sense Deceit</strong>: Because I am so skilled at sensing people's true motives, I gain +2 when I am Cleverly Roguish and attempt to discern if I am being deceived or tricked.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>True Seeing</strong>: Because my patron diety grants me awareness, my powers of observation are divinely enhanced; I may use Divine instead of Focused to notice or perceive things, and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="inspired">Inspired</h4>
<p>Many inquisitors are divinely inspired or favored by their patron deity with various abilities.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Destroy Undead</strong>: Because I am particularly good at destroying lesser undead, while Flashily Divine I may overcome to destroy an Undead mook in my zone or an adjacent zone; the difficulty is equal to the number of hits the mook has remaining. This does work on mobs of nameless Undead mooks, but it does not work on significant NPC Undead that have consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Judgment</strong>: Because I am empowered by my deity to pronounce judgments upon others, I gain +1 while Divine to create advantage to put a spell Aspect on an opponent in my zone or an adjacent zone. Only I can invoke this Aspect, and I may invoke it to improve my rolls against the opponent or to impose a -2 penalty on rolls made by the opponent. This ability uses the Simple Magic Guidelines for create advantage and overcome. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
<p>Creating Advantage with magic is explained in the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a></p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fervent Prayer</strong>: Because my faith is strong, I am sometimes especially blessed by my god. I may spend a Fate point to gain +2 Divine on one (1) action and pray for blessings appropriate to that level of Divine capability. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Holy Hand Grenades</strong>: Because my patron favors me, I am able to craft special reliquaries containing holy power that are released upon impact when thrown, inflicting harm on evil outsiders, undead, and other unnatural creatures nearby. I cannot use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +1 to throw a holy hand grenade into my zone or an adjacent zone, generally against an Average (+1) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful, my holy hand grenade explodes and inflicts a number of shifts of damage equal to my (Careful + Divine) against every eligible target in the zone without splitting shifts between them. Malign outsiders (such as demons, devils, daemons, and proteans), undead, and other similar unnatural creatures are considered to be eligible for this effect.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of holy hand grenades equal to my (Careful + Divine). Other people can not use my holy hand grenades.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Divine +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Turn Undead</strong>: When I am Divine and attack I may target all Undead in my zone or in an adjacent zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Universal Linguist</strong>: Because I have a special ability with languages, I can fluently speak and understand any spoken language I encounter.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="savvy">Savvy</h4>
<p>Many inquisitors are practical people with experience in the sordid ways of the world.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Deceitful</strong>: Because I am so deceitful, I get +2 when I am Cleverly Roguish and create advantage or overcome challenges where my smooth patter applies.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Friendly Diplomacy</strong>: Because I am charmingly friendly to almost everyone and am good at making friends and calming situations down, I gain +2 whenever I attempt to avoid or end a conflict via non-violence, keep the peace, or improve the 'mood of the room'.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skulker</strong>: Because I am so good at escaping notice, I get +2 while I am Sneakily Roguish and create advantage or overcome challenges to avoid notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Slip Away (-2)</strong>: Because I am excellent at getting away with it and slipping away unseen, if there is a momentary distraction or opportunity I may spend a Fate point to immediately exit the scene by means appropriate to the narrative such as slippling away into a crowd, or through a hidden door to a secret escape hatch I happened to know about, or by using a magic item I happened to have, etc. I cannot be pursued in the current scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Thrive Under Pressure</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects to gain a +2 bonus on an action before I roll, if I succeed with style I get the fate point back immediately instead of gaining a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Town And Country Sneaker</strong>: Because I am so good at lurking and being stealthy, I can use Roguish instead of Primal to create advantage and overcome when attempting to avoid being noticed in rural and wildland areas (Roguish is already usable for this in civilized areas).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wheeler Dealer</strong>: Because I excel at talking my way into and out of situations and making deals, I gain +2 while Cleverly Roguish in social situations.</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-8">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Spellblade</strong>: Arcane +3, Combative +1</p>
<p><strong>Gish</strong>: Arcane +2, Combative +2</p>
</div>
<p>The general advice given in the <a href="#the-fighter">the Fighter</a> and <a href="#the-sorcerer">the Sorcerer</a> (or <a href="#the-wizard">the Wizard</a> if you prefer the <a href="#prepared-casting">Prepared Casting</a> model) class translation section is also relevant to magi and you might want to skim them for general arcanist and warrior relevant content. This document concentrates on content of specific interest to magi.</p>
<p>For purposes of Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, there is no real barrier to making a character that is able to cast spells and also be an effective combatant, other than the fact that a starting character has Archetype bonuses totalling to +4 and thus must spread themselves a little thin to properly represent both martial and magical ability.</p>
<p>When making a magus character, you just need to decide if you are going to split your Archetypes using the Spellblade starting set or the Gish starting set. After that take one or more Stunts to firm up your character's ability to be effective at both magical and martial conflict, and that's all there is to it.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Willamena/Willamena.aspx">Willamena</a>{#ctl00_Content_ServerSideLink6_link} is a dangerously headstrong young woman of remarkable talents. Scion of the noble house of Lebeda in Brevoy, Willamena was fascinated by swordplay from a young age and insisted on lessons. Indulged, she soon learned to merge her fencing skills with her natural arcane talent for magic and thus inadvertently started her career as a sword-magi.</p>
<p>Having reached her majority and not in the direct line of succession, Willamena has set out to have a grand adventure before her family marries her off to some clod or other to cement alliances in the worsening political climate of Brevoy. However, it remains to be seen how long her shiny posh exterior will stay unsullied by the harsh realities of life outside of the protected enclaves of the aristocracy.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="three-way-split">Three-way Split</h4>
<p>You can also stretch the concept and add a third Archetype to the mix. If you decide to do this, care should be taken not to spread your character too thin lest they risk not being particularly good at anything. However, it can be accomplished.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Skoth/Skoth.aspx">Skoth</a>{#ctl00_Content_ServerSideLink3_link} is a servant of Nethys dedicated to self-mastery of the disparate arts of magic and swordsmanship.

<p>The following Stunts might be of particular interest to a Magus.</p>
<h4 id="sword-magi">Sword-Magi</h4>
<p>The ability to meld magic and melee is the fundamental concept of a Magus. Stunts such as the following allow a Pathfinder Fate Accelerated character to leverage both their Combative and Arcane bonuses in a conflict. Most if not all Magus characters should probably have some variation of this sort of Stunt.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sword-magi</strong>: Because I have trained as a Sword Magi and can fight using my magic and my blade in tandem, when I am being Combative I may add my Arcane capability to attack with a sword.</p>
</div>
<p>By allocating additional Stunt slots or Refresh, a Magus can make an even more potent version of this sort of Stunt, extending the situations in which they can add both their Arcane and Combative bonuses to various actions.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Champion Sword-magi (-2)</strong>: Because I have trained as a Sword Magi and can fight using my magic and my blade in tandem, when I am being Combative I may add my Arcane capability to attack and defend with a sword.</p>
</div>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Master Sword-magi (-3)</strong>: Because I have trained as a Sword Magi and can fight using my magic and my blade in tandem, when I am being Combative I may add my Arcane capability to attack and defend with a sword. Further, when I am Arcanely attacking or creating advantage against one or more targets in my own zone I may add my Combative capability if it is appropriate to the narrative.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="boost-upgrades">Boost Upgrades</h4>
<p>These Stunts can be taken independently or together. They function the same way, allowing the magus to automatically upgrade boosts to full Aspects which can then be used for various benefits in a conflict. This loosely simulates some [ Arcana]{.text-bold}.</p>
<p>A secondary effect of these Stunts is that when they trigger they grant a significant <strong>tempo advantage</strong> to the magus and this can also allow them to potentially snowball into an unstoppable momentum. Thus there is a tendency for the magus to become more dangerous the longer a conflict progresses.</p>
<p>However, because this kind of Stunt only triggers when a boost occurs there is a fair amount of variance, and also they are less likely to trigger if the magus is significantly outmatched as the odds of getting a boost are decreased.</p>
<p>The following are examples of this idea, but other variations are possible.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Sword Of The Sword-magi</strong>: Because I have trained as a Sword Magi and am adept at using my magic in conjunction with my blade, if I gain a boost when attacking while being Combative or Arcane, I may upgrade the boost to the spell Aspect <strong>Sword Of The Sword-Magi</strong>, with two (2) invokes. This allows me to imbue my sword with magical power.</p>
</div>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Shield Of The Sword-magi</strong>: Because I have trained as a Sword Magi and am adept at using my magic to protect myself in combat, if I gain a boost when defending with either Combative or Arcane, I may upgrade the boost to the spell Aspect <strong>Shield Of The Sword-Magi</strong>, with two (2) invokes. I may invoke this Aspect when defending or to overcome harmful situational Aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="boxed">
<p><strong>Spellstrike of the Sword-magi</strong>:
Because I have trained as a Sword Magi and can fight using my magic and my blade in tandem, if I attack an opponent in the same zone while being Quickly Combative and get a boost I may immediately invoke the boost to attack a second target in the same zone while being Quickly Arcane.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="eldritch-blade">Eldritch Blade</h4>
<p>In the source material one of the key features of a Magus is the ability to apply touch spells via a weapon strike. Boost upgrades such as Sword of the Sword Magi offers a more abstract way to illustrate this idea in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated terms (invoking the Aspect gained from an upgraded boost to add shifts of effect, narratively described as magical effect).</p>
<p>However, some Magi may prefer a less open ended, more concrete approach to this idea. Magically themed stunts that are described as enhancing a weapon attack such as the below options are a way to do that.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Otaro/Otaro.aspx">Otaro</a>{#ctl00_Content_ServerSideLink14_link} is an unwilling pawn of Nethys with an affinity for ancient artifacts. A naturally gifted sword fighter and master Magus, Otaro's youth belies his ability for melding eldritch energies with his deadly bladework.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shocking Blade</strong>: Because I am able to generate a magical paralyzing shock around my weapon, when I would roll 4dF to attack with my weapon I may instead roll 6dF and choose the four (4) best dice for my result. This is an electric attack and I cannot use this Stunt against opponents who are immune to electricity.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Vampiric Blade</strong>: Because I am able to generate a magical necromantic aura around my weapon, when I attack with my weapon and inflict a consequence I may clear one of my stress boxes or my Mild consequence. This is a life-affecting attack and I cannot use this Stunt against opponents who are not living such as constructs, undead, and some outsiders (GM's discretion applies).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Chilling Blade</strong>: Because I am able to generate a magical aura of intense elemental cold around my weapon, when I attack with my weapon and inflict a consequence I may also add a circumstantial Aspect with two free invocations to my target called <strong>Chilled To The Bone</strong>. This Aspect can be overcome by appropriate magic as a Superb (+5) difficulty, or by mundane means of warming the target up as a Great (+4) difficulty (but this usually takes more than an exchange to set up). If the target already has this Aspect applied to them I may add another invocation. This Aspect can be invoked by anyone to hamper the actions of the target. I cannot use this Stunt on targets that are immune to cold.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-monk">The Monk</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Monk class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it's least expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever they are needed most.</p>
<p>For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield---it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade.</p>
<p>These monks elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-9">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Phenom</strong>: Focused +4</p>
<p><strong>Street Fighter</strong>: Focused +3, Roguish +1</p>
<p><strong>Contemplative</strong>: Focused +3, Divine +1</p>
<p><strong>Martial Artist</strong>: Combative +3, Focused +1 :::</p>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-7">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>The only Archetype a monk has to concern themselves with is <strong>Focused</strong>; everything else is optional.</p>
<p>To be considered a monk (and not some other hybrid concept), most characters should start with at least <strong>Focused</strong> +3; which for a standard starting character leaves only the decision of where to put the final +1.</p>
<p>Most monks will go all in on <strong>Focused</strong> +4, but some might prefer to put a +1 into one of the other Archetypes to round out a background or a concept.</p>
<p>However the Martial Artist set of Starting Archetypes illustrates a non-standard option.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> +1 is a great choice for a monk with an urban facet. Additionally, <strong>Focused</strong> and <strong>Roguish</strong> synergize well at higher tiers of play, so a monk character who progresses through a few major milestones as a <strong>Focused</strong> / <strong>Roguish</strong> split should offer a very satisfying play experience.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 might seem somewhat unusual, but some monkish orders also have a spiritual facet and thus splashing <strong>Divine</strong> can make sense in that context.</p>
<p>In the Pathfinder setting of Golarion many monks venerate the god <strong>Irori</strong>, and a monk with <strong>Divine</strong> +1 who worshiped Irori would not be out of place.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> +1 is a reasonable choice for a monk originating from a remote temple or who is a recluse or trained at a mountain shrine or who grew up in the country before becoming a monk. It's a solid choice, particularly for an adventuring monk who might spend a large amount of time traveling the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> +1 is a pretty unlikely option that would most likely be taken to anchor a creative concept incorporating a more &quot;mystical&quot; or overtly magical facet.</p>
<p>For instance, a monk with magical tattoos, or a monk that uses one time &quot;scrolls&quot; to activate their strange abilities might take <strong>Arcane</strong> +1 to &quot;sell&quot; the concept.</p>
<p>Also, a Archetype can always defend against itself; thus a monk with <strong>Arcane</strong> +1 effectively has an &quot;improved save&quot; vs arcane magic. However, this is a relatively weak reason unto itself to invest in a Archetype.</p>
<p><strong>Combatives</strong> +1 can be a choice for a starting monk who also uses weapons, though generally it's more efficient to take a Stunt allowing the monkish character to use <strong>Focused</strong> instead of <strong>Combatives</strong> for a small selection of weapons.</p>
<p>It is also possible to go the other way and make a monk with high <strong>Combatives</strong> and a Stunt like <strong>Barehanded Fighting</strong> to allow <strong>Combatives</strong> to cover barehanded fighting and grappling.</p>
<div class="description">
<p>Because my fighting skills include barehanded combat, I may use Combative instead of Focused when fighting barehanded or grappling.</p>
</div>
<p>Going this route works well for a more practical and less mystical barehanded fighter.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-7">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Monks are quite diverse, and thus all Approaches are equally viable depending upon what sort of monk is being represented.</p>
<p>Contemplative monks are generally <strong>Careful</strong>, while more scholarly or academic monks are usually <strong>Clever</strong>.</p>
<p>Monks dedicated to fancy fighting styles might be <strong>Flashy</strong>, or <strong>Forceful</strong>, or both. Many monks are able to be unusually <strong>Quick</strong> when they need to be.</p>
<p>Monks that practice a secret style or oppose oppressive regimes tend to be <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-monk-exactly">What Kind Of Monk, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;monk&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What &quot;role&quot; do I want my monk to fill?</li>
<li>Is my monk Asian-inspired or an expression of some other concept?</li>
<li>Does my monk concentrate on internal or external abilities?</li>
<li>Does my monk use weapons or do they rely entirely on their innate abilities?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="role-1">Role?</h4>
<p>Unlike some of the other &quot;class&quot; concepts coming from the source material, the monk fills no specific role, instead having a broad (some might even venture semi-random) collection of abilities.</p>
<p>In D&amp;D this leaves the monk as a wildcard, providing some advantages for a small group where the monk can adapt to holes in the party lineup and find a way to provide value, but struggling in a larger group where every role is well covered by a specialist and the monk is cursed to always play second fiddle to someone else.</p>
<p>But when you make a monk character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, you get to decide what role you want your monk to attempt to fill.</p>
<p>You might intend for your monk to be a front line combatant, helping a group to succeed in conflicts. Or perhaps you want to play a &quot;face&quot; or leader monk who takes point in social encounters. Or you might want your monk to be a problem-solver or &quot;support&quot; character who is either specialized to address a particular niche or generalized to have a broad range of &quot;utility&quot; allowing them to adapt to emerging challenges that the group might face in their adventures. And of course, your monk might attempt to fill more than one role or not be intentionally designed to fit any particular role as you prefer. The big take away here is, it is a blank slate for you to paint upon.</p>
<h4 id="inspired-by">Inspired By?</h4>
<p>The monk concept is more about style...flavor...fluff...schtick...call it what you will, than anything concrete or mechanical. Therefore, it is very helpful to have a clear idea in mind when making a monk character.</p>
<p>You might want to stick to the idea of a character influenced in whole or part by ideas taken from Asian cultures or your favorite martial arts movies. You might also prefer to go a different route and express an idea more inline with Western or Fantasy fiction norms. You might even want to express something taken from your own imagination with no basis in either.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Byragh/Byragh.aspx">Byragh</a> is a misanthropic tiefling fueled by a combination of his inner abyssal flames, the pain of poverty-stricken existence, and lifelong suffering. He can project searing heat and scorching fire in a variety of different ways. Additionally he has a wiry strength much greater than his emaciated frame would suggest, and he fights purely dirty. More than one fool has underestimated him with fatal results.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="internal-or-external">Internal or External?</h4>
<p>Your character might be a brutish brawler, or a mystic master of their inner chi or &quot;qinggong&quot; or &quot;neigong&quot;, something in between, or something altogether different.</p>
<p>Thinking about this question should help you settle on a High Concept, and inform your choice of Approaches and Stunts, and also your background concept and portrayal.</p>
<p>Also, as the &quot;monk&quot; concept in D&amp;D is effectively a stand in for a broad spectrum of cultural myth, there is plenty of room to make more atypical or even whimsical characters.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="hard-soft">Hard / Soft</h4>
<p>A trope of martial arts that pops up in some venues is a supposed dichotomy between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; styles. This is usually interpreted as &quot;external&quot; physical and striking arts and &quot;internal&quot; psuedo-mystical or ki / chi based abilities.</p>
<p>If this trope appeals, you might make a monk that is all knuckles and feet and no wuxia, or one that eshews such mundane exertions as punching and kicking in favor of extraordinary abilities, or one that is a mix of practical and mystical.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Ejik/Ejik.aspx">Ejik</a> is a quirky, upbeat, and hyperactive halfling acrobat-tumbler with a knack for tripping up large folk with his energetic antics. But don't let his small size and whimsical nature fool you; this pint-sized ankle biter can be quite deadly when the situation requires it.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="weapon-or-barehanded">Weapon or Barehanded?</h4>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> allows barehanded fighting and grappling by default, but if you want to also use weapons you'll need to either invest in <strong>Combatives</strong> or a Stunt that allows you to use <strong>Focused</strong> instead of <strong>Combatives</strong> with a set of weapons, or a high <strong>Combatives</strong> with a Stunt to cover barehanded.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to engage armed opponents who are using <strong>Combatives</strong> while you are barehanded and using <strong>Focused</strong> without having to constantly think up narrative justifications, you will want to take a Stunt like <strong>I Am A Living Weapon</strong>.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>I Am A Living Weapon</strong>: Because I have honed my body and my skills, my unarmed strikes are equivalent to lethal weapons. I may use Focused instead of Combative when fighting unarmed without any special narrative justification or penalty. In situations where it matters I can choose to be treated as attacking barehanded or attacking with a weapon, whichever benefits me more in the situation. Finally, though I can be inconvenienced or restrained, being disarmed is generally off the table for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Suki/Suki.aspx">Suki</a> is a potent sword-mistress due to her sublime mastery of the Nine Katas of Aori, and her impressive internal ki reserves. She will need all of her skills to succeed at her personal quest to salvage her honor by recovering her family's ancestral sword.</p>
</div>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Volus/Volus.aspx">Volus</a> is a massive physical specimen, hugely muscled but lithe as a cat. Cast out of his Shoanti tribe for being a thuggish meathead and stirring up needless trouble, he now makes a living as a profressional fighter when he can find gigs and otherwise gets by as best he can. His fighting style is of his own devising, featuring a lot of powerful punches, knee strikes, and elbow smashes...and sometimes he just picks up an opponent and tosses them around like a rag doll.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-9">Stunts</h3>
<p>Monk characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#fitness-stunts">Fitness Stunts</a>, <a href="#competence-stunts">Competence Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>, <a href="#mental-stunts">Mental Stunts</a>, <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#special-stunts">Special Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some monks. However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="mentally-and-physically-fit">Mentally And Physically Fit</h4>
<p>Most monks have developed extreme mental and physical fitness as part of their training.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Impressive Reflexes</strong>: Because I have excellent reflexes, I gain +1 while Quickly attacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Indomitable</strong>: Because I refuse to give in and I always vigorously protect myself, I get +1 when I am Forceful and defend if I am aware that I am in danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Just Roll With It</strong>: Because I excel at avoiding harm and rolling with whatever comes my way, I can use more than one stress box to absorb stress from an attack (normally, only one stress box may be used to offset stress from a single attack).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Naturally Sneaky</strong>: Because I am innately good at being sneaky, I may use Focused instead of Roguish or Primal when Sneakily attempting to avoid notice. However, I suffer a -1 penalty when I do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Naturally Sneaky (-2)</strong>: Because I am innately good at being sneaky, I may use Focused instead of Roguish or Primal when Sneakily attempting to avoid notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sprinter</strong>: Because I am able to put on a little extra burst of speed when I need to, once per scene whenever I move a zone I may choose to immediately move another zone for free and this does not prevent me from attacking. Alternately, if I do nothing but move I may use this ability to move two (2) extra zones.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Strider</strong>: Because I am fleet of foot and able to move quickly, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an extra zone and I am unobstructed by foot hazards of less than knee height. If I am in a contest involving me walking rapidly or running, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sublime Expertise (-2)</strong>: Because I am extremely skilled and rarely blunder, whenever I make a 4dF roll I treat any result of less than 0 as -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Tumbler</strong>: Because I am excellent at acrobatically flipping around and tumbling, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an additional zone and I am unobstructed by minor obstacles that I can tumble around or flip over. If I am in a contest involving me running away from something or avoiding capture, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Very Strong</strong>: Because I am so strong, I get +2 while I am Forcefully Focused and create advantage or overcome when my great strength is a factor.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="martial-artist">Martial Artist</h4>
<p>Most monks have some skill at fighting.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Brawler</strong>: Because I am so strong, I get +2 while I am Forcefully Focused and attack when fighting unarmed or grappling or when throwing heavy blunt things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Canny Guard</strong>: Because of my skill and experience as a warrior it is difficult to catch me off guard. When I am defending against physical attacks and tie, my opponent does not get a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>I Am A Living Weapon</strong>: Because I have honed my body and my skills, my unarmed strikes are equivalent to lethal weapons. I may use Focused instead of Combative when fighting unarmed without any special narrative justification or penalty. In situations where it matters I can choose to be treated as attacking barehanded or attacking with a weapon, whichever benefits me more in the situation. Finally, though I can be inconvenienced or restrained, being disarmed is generally off the table for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Improved Disarm</strong>:Because I like to disarm others, I get +1 when I am Quick and attempt to create advantage to attach the situational Aspect <strong>Disarmed</strong> to other people who weild weapons.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Making It Count</strong>: Because I am able to make my attacks really matter, on an attack that succeeds with style I may spend a fate point to prevent the target from checking a stress box to reduce the stress of the attack. The target may still take consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>One Against Many</strong>: Because I am skilled at defending myself against multiple attackers, I gain +2 to defend when I fight alone against two or more opponents. A single mook defined as a mob counts as being multiple opponents for purposes of this ability as long as there are two or more 'individuals' within the mob. 'Fighting alone' in this context means no allies are in my zone or an adjacent zone, and no ally is aiding me or attacking my opponents.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Passing Attack</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quick and attack, if I choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move one (1) zone away as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pounce!</strong>: Because I excel at leaping into combat in a startling burst of aggression, I gain +4 on my first attack in a conflict if I act first and can charge, lunge at, or pounce upon an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Because of my impressive resilience, once per session if I would take a Consequence I may instead spend a Fate point.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Retribution</strong>: Because my retribution is terrible when I succesfully attack an opponent who has inflicted stress or consequences upon me in the current conflict I inflict +1 shift more damage and this damage cannot be reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Stunning Fist</strong>: Because I have learned how to throw a vicious punch, whenever I am Forcefully Focused and attack barehanded, if I succeed with style and choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to apply the situational Aspect <strong>Stunned!</strong> to my target with two (2) invokes. The target can remove this Aspect by overcoming a Superb (+5) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Thunderous Jab</strong>: Because I have learned how to throw a vicious punch, whenever I am Quickly Focused and attack barehanded, if I succeed with style and choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to apply the situational Aspect <strong>Staggered!</strong> to my target with two (2) invokes. The target can remove this Aspect by overcoming a Superb (+5) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="mystically-adept">Mystically Adept</h4>
<p>Some monks have mastered unusual abilities, or developed their inner chi to such extremes that they are more than mundane.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Close Call</strong>: Because I excel at getting out of really bad situations, I can spend a fate point to concede after I already rolled to defend (normally a concession must be made instead of rolling to defend).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Cloud Step</strong>: Because I have mastered a mystic discipline, I may defy the normal bonds of the earth to float upon the wind and available contact points as if I weighed no more than a feather. I am never harmed or unduly inconvenienced by falling, even if I am unconscious. However this effect is temporarily cancelled if I am encumbered or anchored by more than half my own body weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Damage Reduction</strong>: Because I am more durable than normal, I reduce by one (1) all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Danger Sense</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +3 while Quickly Focused to notice things that are dangerous, fast moving, or pose an imminent threat to my safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fast Healing</strong>[:]{#ctl00_Content_FastHealing_lineFastHealing} Because I heal extremely quickly, I reduce by 2 all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks. I appear to take damage but it 'heals' almost immediately in an impressive and potentially intimidating display. However, this does not work versus stress inflicted as damage by a specific reasonably common kind of attack and in fact I take +1 shift of stress from such attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fated Fortune</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects I gain a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Focused Resistance</strong>: Because my innate fortitude and intrinsic vitality protects me, I may use Focused to defend against magical and unusual attacks without needing special narrative justification or first creating an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Unusual Senses</strong>: Because I a have unusual senses I gain +1 while Focused to notice things, and I can sense things that are not detectable by normal senses.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-6">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="self-buffing-barehanded-strikers">Self-buffing Barehanded Strikers</h4>
<p>The source material offers monks as a putatively melee oriented class. that eventually accrues a laundry list of supernormal abilties as they progress.</p>
<p>Monks benefit from the best &quot;saving throws&quot; available in the game, a high rate of movement, scaling barehanded damage, and some other useful (but seemingly randomly chosen) class features.</p>
<h4 id="underpowered-and-maligned">Underpowered And Maligned</h4>
<p>Monks are severely hampered by several problems. Despite being a primary melee based class, the monk only has intermediate attack rate progression, sub-optimal hitpoints, and at higher levels difficulty hurting things with special resistances without expensive magic items.</p>
<p>The monk class is also one of the more divisive in D&amp;D in general, and Pathfinder is no exception. Some people find the entire concept to be out of place in the largely western influenced fantasy genre.</p>
<p>Others have no philosophical problem with the idea but take exception at the monk's low power level, or their quirky array of fluff abilities, or the fact that the class is woefully Multiple Ability Dependent aka <strong>MAD</strong> (meaning a character of the class needs multiple high stats rather than a single high stat to be competitive).</p>
<p>Still others find it frustrating that the entire breadth of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia">Wuxia</a> is shoehorned into the rather odd assortment of class abilities granted by the monk.</p>
<p>The source material does offer ways to differentiate monks using &quot;archetypes&quot; (as defined in the Pathfinder rule books) that allow swapping out the more useless class features for better ones, style feats, and other class and level manipulation shenanigans. There are also certain specific feat chains that can be cobbled together and exploited to help make the monk more competitive. However, an unpleasant amount of system exploitation is involved.</p>
<p>Due to the perceived problems and despite a few specific viable builds, the monk as a whole is widely regarded as being in competition for the weakest or worst class in Pathfinder. Bottom line, the class is much maligned and the potential of the overall concept largely falls on the floor.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-5">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The good news is, if you are making a monkish character for play in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, you have the freedom to express whatever sort of Wuxia or martial artist or barehanded pugilist concept you want.</p>
<p>Inspired by the rich traditions and fiction of Asian cultures, what monks are [meant]  to represent is much more interesting and exciting...</p>
<div class="margin-small square-lists">
<ul>
<li>Incredibly skilled, amazing devotees of semi-mystical martial arts capable of physical and mental feats beyond the ken of normal folks.</li>
<li>Barehanded street fighters and brawlers, masters of diverse fighting arts.</li>
<li>Nearly superhuman masters of the inner potential of ki energy.</li>
<li>Practitioners of strange hard, soft, hidden, animal inspired, and even forbidden styles of combat.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I.e., all the crazy stuff seen in countless &quot;kung fu&quot; movies.</p>
<p>The flexibility and permissiveness of Fate Accelerated is ideally suited to allowing this kind of character to excel, and making a monkish character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated offers a lot of opportunities to express a distinct concept and play it to great heights of acheivement.</p>
<p>The system is not going to get in your way or force you down an arbitrarily narrow path. The only limiters are your imagination and the number of Aspect and Stunt slots available to you. :::</p>
<h2 id="the-oracle">The Oracle</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Oracle class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand.</p>
<p>Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
<p>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>Because Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't use spell lists and the magic guidelines allow free casting by default, the differences between a cleric and a oracle boils down to the wording of Aspects and Troubles to model a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/mysteries">Mystery</a>{#ctl00_Content_MysteryLink_link .purple} and a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/oracle-curses">Curse</a>{#ctl00_Content_CurseLink_link .purple} in order to capture the desired &quot;Oracle&quot; feel, and Stunts to model any special abilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended that players interested in making an oracle type character refer to <a href="#the-cleric">the Cleric</a> class translation section and choose their Aspects, Trouble, and Stunts appropriately to suit their concept.</p>
<p>In the case of an oracle character, any Stunt or ability that refers to &quot;faith&quot; would simply be interpreted through the lens of their mystery and curse instead of the religion of a patron deity.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-10">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Fervent</strong>: Divine +4</p>
<p><strong>Devout</strong>: Combative +1, Divine +3</p>
<p><strong>Pious</strong>: Combative +2, Divine +2</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-7">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-6">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>From a certain perspective, the Oracle class is an example of mechanics before concept. Sorcerers allowed players to make a full Arcane spellcaster using the &quot;spontaneous&quot; spell casting model, but no such class existed for Divine casters.</p>
<p>Thus, the Oracle was made primarily to fill that mechanical gap and the class amounts to a copy and paste of Sorcerers with some chrome changes. Concept was entirely secondary.</p>
<p>The one distinct quirk of the class is the idea of a &quot;Curse&quot; afflicting each Oracle, but functionally they amount to a bundle of useful abilities paired with a detriment.</p>
<p>From a fiction perspective, overall the class is not well integrated into the setting (though there are a few exceptions).</p>
<p>As Pathfinder Fate Accelerated is far more concerned with concepts than mechanics, the concept of Oracles offers little to distinguish itself from the Cleric concept. However, individual players and GM's can overcome this by finding ways to more seamlessly integrate the Oracle concept into their campaigns.</p>
<h2 id="the-paladin">The Paladin</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Paladin class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine.</p>
<p>Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve.</p>
<p>In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline.</p>
<p>As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful.</p>
<p>Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.&quot;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-8">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>The only two Archetypes a paladin has to concern themselves with are <strong>Combatives</strong> and <strong>Divine</strong>.</p>
<p>Most starting paladins looking to match the source material should consider the Pious set of Starting Archetypes, plus one or two combat related Stunts to shore up their &quot;warrior&quot; facet.</p>
<p>Starting paladins who prefer to accentuate their ability to fight should consider the Militant set of Starting Archetypes, plus one or two divine related Stunts to shore up their &quot;holy&quot; facet.</p>
<p>Either way, a paladin's Archetype increase from their first major milestone should usually be applied to Divine to reinforce the concept.</p>
<p>It's also possible to base a paladin on Roguish or Focused instead of Combative, but it would put some pressure on Stunt choices and require some patience to pay off with the passing of milestones.</p>

<h3 id="approach-considerations-8">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Paladins of different gods are putatively different, but in practice most paladins are more alike than they are disimilar.</p>
<p>Not to cast aspersions but few paladins are particularly <strong>Clever</strong>, and even fewer are <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p>Many paladins are <strong>Careful</strong>, and can also be quite <strong>Flashy</strong> when their ire is up and the smiting ensues. But some trend more towards <strong>Forceful</strong>, leaving off on the sermonizing and litany spouting in favor of letting their relentless assault speak for itself.</p>
<p>And some paladins are at least a little <strong>Quick</strong>, but no more so than is typical among those who live by the blade.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-paladin-exactly">What Kind Of Paladin, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the paladin category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<div class="margin-small">
<ol>
<li>What deity does my paladin serve?</li>
<li>Does my paladin feel that they are only responsible for their own actions and have the ability to coexist with others who do not share their views, or do they hold those around them to the same code of conduct the paladin adheres to and persecute those who do not follow it?</li>
<li>Does my paladin focus more on their divine or their martial abilities?</li>
<li>Does my paladin have a steed or a divine weapon, or something else altogether, or nothing of the sort?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h4 id="whom-do-you-serve-2">Whom Do You Serve?</h4>
<p>The first question is probably the most important for framing the nature of your character.</p>
<p>You can use the choice of patron to guide your decisions about your character's Aspects and Stunts, to inform your portrayal, the nature of your character's interactions with others, and so on.</p>
<p>If your group is allowing the concept of a paladin as a divinely empowered warrior dedicated to any deity rather than just the narrow &quot;lawful good or evil&quot; definition enforced in the source material, the opportunity for character differentiation expands considerably.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Radje/Radje.aspx">Radje</a> is a dour and aggressive examplar of the war god Gorum. Eager for battle, for the opportunity to repeatedly test himself in the crucible of combat, he stomps through the world like a living seige weapon, a lumbering war machine that walks upright on two legs.</p>
<p>Radje shows his dedication to the ideals of his bloodthirsty god in the only way that matters; deed by bloody deed.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="contemplative-or-evangelist-2">Contemplative or Evangelist?</h4>
<p>Some paladins are portrayed as being inwardly focused, responsible for their own deeds and conduct. This sort of paladin can generally get along with others and cooperate towards a common goal with people of different viewpoints, at least to some extent. This is conducive to party dynamics and getting things done. However, it can also be quite dull.</p>
<p>Other paladins are portrayed as being outwardly focused, intent on imposing the worship of their religion and the tenets of their patron upon the world. This sort of paladin often has a difficult time working and playing well with others, and often finds themselves embroiled in some kind of strife due to their evangelical overtures and intolerance for other beliefs. This can make for some great drama, but on the other hand it can also get quite stale and annoying.</p>
<p>Regardless of where your paladin is at on that spectrum, it should guide your choice of High Concept and Trouble. It will also indicate if you plan to portray the character in an antagonistic or cooperative manner relative to other player characters.</p>
<h4 id="divine-or-combative-dominant">Divine or Combative Dominant?</h4>
<p>Some paladins favor the warrior arts, while others favor deific pursuits. Obviously, where your paladin sits on this spectrum will guide your decision on how to assign your Archetype bonuses. For instance, <a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Bordos/Bordos.aspx">Bordos</a> follows the Pious set of Starting Archetypes, while <a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Mirriam/Mirriam.aspx">Mirriam</a> goes the Militant route.</p>
<div class="margin-small">
<div class="description">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Bordos/Bordos.aspx">Bordos</a> is a stolid, stalwart, reliable, dependable, honor-bound human unusually dedicated to the service of the Dwarven god of the forge, Torag. Human paladins of Torag are &quot;essentially unheard of&quot; but Bordos is the exception that proves the rule, and in truth despite his large and tall frame he seems more Dwarf than man in word and deed. Determined to bring honor to his calling, Bordos finds further favor from Torag with every passing year and may one day be counted among the great champions of his faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Mirriam/Mirriam.aspx">Mirriam</a> is a stern and no-nonsense woman dedicated to the service of Sarenrae, the Dawnflower. Though kind to women and children, Mirriam is not overly fond of men and is rather standoffish. She is bold, zealous, and willing to intimidate or threaten those obstructing her holy mission. Mirriam seeks out those who have committed evils, and delivers final mercy to any who cannot be redeemed.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="steed-or-divine-weapon">Steed or Divine Weapon?</h4>
<p>Some paladins have special steeds, and others get holy weapons. If you want either you'll need to allocate one or more Stunt slots to cover such abilities. If not, you can use those slots for other things.</p>
<h3 id="stunts-10">Stunts</h3>
<p>Paladin characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#deific-stunts">Deific Stunts</a>, <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some paladins.</p>
<p>However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="faith-worthiness-2">Faith Worthiness</h4>
<p>Paladins that are granted abilities by their patrons can lose access to those abilities if they do something unworthy of their faith; thus such Stunts typically include language to that effect.</p>
<p>This is left to the GM's discretion, but it isn't intended to create antagonistic situations. Ultimately a player should have a large measure of control over their character's story; any failings of faith should be regarded as a roleplaying opportunity.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="holy-holy-1">Holy Holy</h4>
<p>Paladins are invested with divine power by their patron deities, though the nature of such favor varies from deity to deity, or even from individual to individual.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Detect Evil</strong>: Because I am sensitive to ethical and moral propensities, I am able to sense strong concentrations of immorality and evilness in individuals, objects, and areas from six (6) zones away even if the source in not detectable to my other senses. Additionally, I gain +2 to notice relevant concentrations of evil while Focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Destroy Undead</strong>: Because I am particularly good at destroying lesser undead, while Flashily Divine I may overcome to destroy an Undead mook in my zone or an adjacent zone; the difficulty is equal to the number of hits the mook has remaining. This does work on mobs of nameless Undead mooks, but it does not work on significant NPC Undead that have consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Aegis</strong>: Because my patron deity protects me I may use Divine to defend against non-Divine magical and unusual attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Favor</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against physical attacks, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Renewal</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, when I am Carefully Divine I may pray for aid to clear a stress box or a Mild Consequence, or to downgrade a Moderate or Severe Consequence, by overcoming a difficulty equal to the stress box's or Consequence's numerical value. This only works on my own stress and Consequences, not that of others. If I fail to overcome the difficulty I may not attempt to clear the same stress box or heal the same Consequence again; I must wait for it to clear by other means. I cannot use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Favored Follower</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, once per scene when I spend a fate point to get a reroll I may proceed as if I had rolled +2 on the dice instead of rolling a second time. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fervent Prayer</strong>: Because my faith is strong, I am sometimes especially blessed by my god. I may spend a Fate point to gain +2 Divine on one (1) action and pray for blessings appropriate to that level of Divine capability. I may not use this ability if I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shield of Faith</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I may add my Divine capability as a bonus to defend against indirect attacks such as poisons and strange abilities and magic, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>True Seeing</strong>: Because my patron diety grants me awareness, my powers of observation are divinely enhanced; I may use Divine instead of Focused to notice or perceive things, and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="defender-of-the-faith-1">Defender Of The Faith</h4>
<p>Paladins are martially capable, able to serve as defenders of their faith and the faithful. Some rely purely on skill, while others benefit from blessings that aid them in battle.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Canny Guard</strong>: Because of my skill and experience as a warrior it is difficult to catch me off guard. When I am defending against physical attacks and tie, my opponent does not get a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combative Aegis</strong>: Because I have developed my defensive form to a high degree of skill, when I am Carefully Combative and appropriately equipped, if someone else in my zone is physically attacked I may defend on their behalf. However I take any shifts of damage that get past my defenses, rather than the intended target.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Damage Reduction</strong>: Because I am more durable than normal, I reduce by one (1) all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Divine Weapon (-2)</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, I have been graced with a divinely empowered weapon. If I have recently done something unworthy of my faith, the weapon loses its special abilities until I have atoned.</p>
<div class="description">

<p><strong>Heavy Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear heavy armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am heavily armored.</p>
</div>

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Powerful Attack</strong>: Because I am so skilled at delivering forceful attacks, I gain +2 when I am Forcefully Combative and attack while armed with a weapon.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Smite The Unworthy</strong>: Because I am favored by my patron deity, when I am being Combative I may add my Divine capability to attack opponents who I know to be beyond redemption, unless I have recently done something unworthy of my faith.</p>

<h3 id="source-material-notes-8">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="self-buffing-strikers-1">Self-buffing Strikers</h4>
<p>The source material offers paladins as melee combat focused characters who are blessed with divine gifts that aid them in standing against the evils of the world.</p>
<h4 id="tanks-1">Tanks</h4>
<p>Self-healing, armor, and plenty of hit points allows paladins to be effective tanks.</p>
<h4 id="support">Support</h4>
<p>In addition to being respectable front line combatants, Paladins can become quite good healers and status effect nullifiers.</p>
<h4 id="pet">Pet</h4>
<p>Additionally, some knightly paladins ride powerful steeds, while others get a fancy divinely empowered weapon.</p>
<h4 id="alignment-code-of-conduct-1">Alignment / Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>The downside of course is the infamous paladin code of conduct, the morass that is D&amp;D alignment, and the propensity for different GM's and players to interpret moral and ethical quandries differently.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-7">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated joyfully dispenses with the alignment concept altogether; &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;evilness&quot; and &quot;lawfulness&quot; and etc. can be a thing, but it is based upon interpretation of Aspects and deeds. If you want to play a &quot;lawful good&quot; character as per the source material, so be it.</p>
<p>Pick your character's High Concept, Trouble, and Aspects appropriately to further that ideal and then portray your character accordingly. But there's no mechanical impact other than what is ordinarily available in Fate Accelerated.</p>
<p>Also, the source material limits divinely inspired warriors to lawful good and lawful evil alignments (paladins and anti-paladins). If you want to play a divinely inspired character of another alignment, that necessitates whole other classes such as the Inquisitor or the more recent Warpriest.</p>
<p>In Pathfinder Fate Accelerated however, &quot;paladin&quot; is just a concept...a label. If you want to make a &quot;chaotic good&quot; divinely inspired warrior dedicated to the service of some deity, and call that character a paladin, go for it.</p>
<p>The source material also does little to differentiate between the paladins of different gods, they are locked into rather vanilla sameness by the class and level structure. Thus in the source material paladins are a fairly homogeneous lot, baring any &quot;archetype&quot; (as defined in the Pathfinder rule books), prestige class, or similar shenanigans.</p>
<p>But in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated you are not obligated to limit yourself to arbitrary restrictions rooted in sacred cows or gamist design that puts mechanics before concept.</p>
<p>Feel free to personalize your paladin to have abilities particularly suited to their deity's focus and fluff; this will not only make your character more distinctive and memorable, it will also make the character's choice of deity matter more to the story.</p>
<p>The only limiter is whether the group or GM wants to maintain the arbitrary restrictions of the source material or not. As a player interested in expressing their creativity you should first check with your GM to determine what they will allow.</p>
<h2 id="the-ranger">The Ranger</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Ranger class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey.</p>
<p>Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range.</p>
<p>Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike; while some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game---even fugitives among their own people.&quot;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-9">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>Four Archetypes are of potential interest to a ranger, but an individual ranger might only have bonuses in two of them. <strong>Primal</strong> covers the &quot;wildlands survivor&quot; facet, <strong>Combatives</strong> covers the &quot;warrior&quot; facet, <strong>Roguish</strong> covers the &quot;skilled and canny&quot; facet, and <strong>Focused</strong> covers the &quot;alert and fit&quot; facet.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> is the most essential Archetype of the four for a ranger. All rangers should have at least <strong>Primal</strong> +1. However, gaining <strong>Primal</strong> +3 or higher is something that can be deferred until some major milestones have passed, or avoided altogether for a ranger who is not a spell caster.</p>
<p><strong>Combatives</strong> is the next most essential Archetype for many but not all rangers. Rangers that are top-tier warriors who also happen to have a wilderness slant to them will generally go heavy <strong>Combatives</strong> with a splash of <strong>Primal</strong>, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> is also a solid Archetype to base a ranger character on, such as the Stalker set of Starting Archetypes demonstrates.</p>
<p>Superficially, some people might assume that <strong>Roguish</strong> is synonymous with &quot;thief&quot;, but that is not the case. <strong>Roguish</strong> encompasses a broad range of skills, and offers a lot to a ranger that is not entirely anchored in being competent in wilderness settings.</p>
<p>So called &quot;urban rangers&quot;, bounty hunters, thief-catchers, some scouts and skirmishers, and the like are all examples of roguish rangers.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> is a secondary Archetype for rangers. Rangers are generally defined by their skill more than their innate superiority, and going too heavy into <strong>Focused</strong> can dillute this theme, pulling a character towards other character concepts. <strong>Focused</strong> +1 is a good splash for practically any kind of ranger, but creeping up higher on a starting character will tend to make the character seem less like a ranger and more like <a href="#the-barbarian">the barbarian</a> or some other concept altogether. :::</p>
<p>Most starting rangers looking to match the source material should consider the Commando set of Starting Archetypes, while starting rangers who prefer to accentuate their wilderness abilities and ramp up into spellcasting should consider the Survivalist set of Starting Archetypes. Rangers that want to be capable in both urban and wilderness settings should consider the Stalker set of Starting Archetypes.</p>
<p>And of course, you are free to twiddle the dials to whatever permutation you like; for instance <strong>Combative</strong> +1, <strong>Primal</strong> +3 or <strong>Combative</strong> +1, <strong>Roguish</strong> +1, <strong>Primal</strong> +2, or even <strong>Combative</strong> +1, <strong>Roguish</strong> +1, <strong>Focused</strong> +1, <strong>Primal</strong> +1 are all equally valid.</p>
<p>Going a little further afield, the Feral set of Starting Archetypes offers an extreme variation on the ranger concept. A character going that route would have to rely heavily on Aspects, Approaches, and Stunt choices to anchor the character in the ranger concept instead of something more like a druid or similar nature-based full caster. <a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Pailey/Pailey.aspx">Pailey</a> is an example of such a verge character; she's somewhere between druid and ranger, but her Stunts pull the character concept closer towards ranger.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Pailey/Pailey.aspx">Pailey</a> is a half-wild Half-Elf with a strong connection to all things sylvan. In addition to being fully at home in the woodlands, able to run as swiftly as the wolves and strike just as suddenly, she is also innately able to work powerul magics affecting the natural world.</p>

<p><strong>Feral</strong>: Focused +1, Primal +3 :::</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-9">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>A <strong>Flashy</strong> ranger is virtually unheard of.</p>
<p>Rangers are pretty much invariably <strong>Sneaky</strong> and usually <strong>Careful</strong>. Some are also <strong>Quick</strong> or <strong>Clever</strong>, or both.</p>
<p>Some rangers are <strong>Forceful</strong>, but they are a minority; rangers tend to be more subtle.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-ranger-exactly">What Kind Of Ranger, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;ranger&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does my ranger have the ability to cast spells, or do they instead rely on their advanced skills and competence?</li>
<li>Does my ranger specialize in the wilderness or a particular terrain type, or are they equally capable in all environments?</li>
<li>Does my ranger specialize in a particular fighting style such as two-weapon fighting or archery, or is how they engage in conflict not a central theme for the character?</li>
<li>Does my ranger have an emnity with one or more types of opponents or are they equally capable against any type of foe?</li>
</ol>
<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="specialists-specialist">Specialist's Specialist</h4>
<p>In a broad sense, D&amp;D rangers are a very specialized sub-type of fighter, or a fighter-druid hybrid.</p>
<p>However, the D&amp;D conception of a ranger doesn't necessarily match up that closely with the concept as presented in non-D&amp;D licensed fiction and mythology.</p>
<p>If your idea of a ranger is more of a hunter, or a woodsy warrior, or a forest bandit, or lightly armored infantry, and so on, you are free to express your concept.</p>
<p>A large design space falls within the label of &quot;ranger&quot;; have fun with it.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="spellcaster-or-not">Spellcaster or Not?</h4>
<p>If you want your ranger to be a spellcaster you need to decide how deeply you are going to invest in <strong>Primal</strong>. If you want to start as a full spell caster, you'll need <strong>Primal</strong> +3, which won't leave much room to incorporate other facets into the character.</p>
<p>If you want to play a character who has some wilderness tricks and perhaps a few extra-normal or minor spell-like abilities you can go with <strong>Primal</strong> +2.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <strong>Primal</strong> +1 is where you'll want to turn the dial.</p>
<p>And if you don't want your ranger to be a spellcaster it opens up possibilities for other special abilities, such as animal companions, fancy fighting styles, and favored terrain and foes.</p>
<h4 id="preferred-environment-or-all-terrain">Preferred Environment or All-Terrain?</h4>
<p>Some rangers specialize in a specific kind of terrain, such as the mountains, or the forest, and hone their skills in their chosen environment to extreme mastery. Other rangers are comfortable in any clime and place, possibly even in cities and other bastions of civilization.</p>
<p>Answering this question will lead you to settle on the disposition of <strong>Primal</strong> and <strong>Roguish</strong> for your ranger. And obviously, if you are going &quot;full wilderness&quot; you shouldn't assign any +'s to <strong>Roguish</strong>.</p>
<p>If your ranger does have a favored terrain, it is also more likely that they might have an animal companion from that terrain.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Garak/Garak.aspx">Garak</a> is a survivor in every sense of the word. An infamous bounty hounter, reknowned for his ability to track down and kill or capture criminals, highwaymen, brigands, debtors, and such like no matter where they might flee to or where they might hide. Competent, tricky, and resourceful, he's a bad Dwarf to cross and an even worse one to have on your trail.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="fighting-style-or-general-mayem">Fighting Style or General Mayem?</h4>
<p>Many, but not all, rangers specialize in a particular fighting style. Others are just generally capable of physical violence by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>Either way, answering this question will lead you to adjust the <strong>Combatives</strong> dial on your ranger, and will also guide your choice of Stunts. It is probably also suggestive of an Aspect or even your High Concept.</p>
<p>For instance, if a defining feature of your ranger is that you are a skilled archer or a dual-wielder at a minimum you'll likely want a decent <strong>Combatives</strong> bonus and at least one relevant Stunt to anchor that concept.</p>
<p>Alternately, if you are not taking <strong>Combatives</strong> at all but you want to be a weapon specialist of some kind you'll definitely need to allocate a Stunt slot to allowing a different Archetype to be used in place of <strong>Combatives</strong> in certain scenarios, such as &quot;when armed appropriately&quot;.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Yuler/Yuler.aspx">Yuler</a> is a skilled tracker and a deadly accurate archer. Swift and stealthy, he makes every arrow count and rarely misses. And almost nothing avoids his notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p>A good way for a ranger with high <strong>Combatives</strong> to differentiate themselves from a fighter is in their choice of Approaches.</p>
<p>Fighters tend to favor <strong>Forceful</strong> with <strong>Flashy</strong> being another favorite for more swashbuckling types, while rangers tend to prefer <strong>Sneaky</strong> and <strong>Careful</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="favored-enemy-or-equal-opportunity">Favored Enemy or Equal Opportunity?</h4>
<p>Some rangers have one or more kinds of creature or person whom they are particularly good at tracking down and killing. Other rangers are less picky about their opponents.</p>
<p>If you want to incorporate the source material's &quot;favored enemy&quot; or &quot;giant-killer&quot; (reaching further back to earlier editions) theme it will generally just boil down to using one or more Stunt slots to gain a bonus against a particular kind of opponent. You might also reflect such an emnity in an Aspect to anchor the idea.</p>
<h3 id="stunts-11">Stunts</h3>
<p>Ranger characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#primordial-stunts">Primordial Stunts</a>, <a href="#warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</a>, <a href="#archer-stunts">Archer Stunts</a>, <a href="#durability-stunts">Durability Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some rangers. However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="primal-hunter-1">Primal Hunter</h4>
<p>Many rangers are masters of the natural world, supreme trackers and hunters, canny in their instincts, and feral in their ferocity.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alertness</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +2 while Focused to notice things.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Ambusher</strong>: Because I am great at setting up ambushes, I gain +1 when I Sneakily set up an ambush or create a related advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Foe Bane</strong>: Because I have a favored enemy Race, when I succesfully attack a target of that Race I inflict +2 shifts of extra stress. Additionally, if my attack results in a tie I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on the defender, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hunting Archer</strong>: Because I am a master archer and hunter, I may use Primal instead of Combative to attack with any kind of bow and arrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pass Without Trace</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in the wildlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in wildland areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 2)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pounce!</strong>: Because I excel at leaping into combat in a startling burst of aggression, I gain +4 on my first attack in a conflict if I act first and can charge, lunge at, or pounce upon an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Stalking Hunter</strong>: Because I am so good at stalking, hunting, and pouncing upon prey unnoticed, I get +2 when I am Sneakily Primal and create advantage or overcome challenges to set up and execute ambushes while in wildlands.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Strider</strong>: Because I am fleet of foot and able to move quickly, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an extra zone and I am unobstructed by foot hazards of less than knee height. If I am in a contest involving me walking rapidly or running, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Swamp Fighter</strong>: Because I am so adept at fighting within swampy areas and using my environment effectively, I may add Primal as a bonus when I am Combative in swamps and marshlands.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Swamp Stride</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in swamps and marshlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth and areas of water, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in swampy areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 3)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Tracker</strong>: Because I am so good at tracking a quary, I get +2 when I am Carefully Primal and create advantage or overcome challenges related to tracking things down in wilderness settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Two Weapon Fighting (-2)</strong>: Because I am so skilled at dual-wielding two weapons, I gain +1 when I am Combative and attack or defend while armed appropriately. Additionally if I make a physical attack while armed appropriately and split shifts between exactly two opponents, I inflict +1 shift of additional damage to each target.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Urban Jungle</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of fading away, blending in, and avoiding notice even in urban areas among people, I can use Primal instead of Roguish to create advantage and overcome when attempting to avoid being noticed in civilized areas (Primal is already usable for this in rural, wildland areas).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Quick Shot</strong>: Because I am skilled at rapidly shooting arrows, I gain +1 when I am Quick and attack with any kind of bow or a hand crossbow against a target in my zone or an adjacent zone. If I hit I inflict +1 shift of additional stress.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Weapon Mastery (-3)</strong>: Because I have spent many years mastering a type of weapon, I gain +1 to Combatives when I attack, defend, create advantage, or overcome while using any weapon of that type.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="durable-survivor-1">Durable Survivor</h4>
<p>Many rangers are unusually resilient survivors, capable of living through incredible trauma and harsh conditions.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Mind-Affecting</strong>: Because I am immune to mind-affecting abilities, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on mental coersion or disorientation.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Poison</strong>: Because I am immune to poison, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on poison.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Living Off The Land</strong>: Because I am adept at surviving off of what nature offers me, I am always able to find enough food and water to keep myself and a couple of other people or animals healthy while in wildlands and rural areas (i.e. above ground and not near a city or town). Additionally if I've had at least half a day to become familiar with the terrain in a specific area of wilderness I gain +1 on all actions while being Primal. How large the area of wilderness might be is left to the GM's discretion, but it should be at least five square miles.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Primal Reduction</strong>: Because I am significantly more rugged, robust, and survivable due to my deep connection with primal forces, I reduce by one (1) all physical stress inflicted on me, and I reduce by two (2) all environmental stress inflicted on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Because of my impressive resilience, once per session if I would take a Consequence I may instead spend a Fate point.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rogue's Reflexes</strong>: Because I have great reflexes and am able to evade harm better than most people, I may use Roguish to defend against any kind of indirect or surprise attack and to avoid harm by getting out of the way of it. Narratively this can take many forms, such as rolling out of the way, ducking behind cover, 'seeing it coming' and somehow interupting the attack, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Roguish +2 to use.</p>
<p>NOTE: Roguish +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Roguish +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Warrior's Mettle</strong>: Because I have trained extensively and am made of sterner stuff than most people, I may use Combatives to defend against ranged attacks and targeted magic by deflecting such attacks with a precise flick or parry of my weapon, or with my armor or a shield, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Combative +2 to use.</p>
<p>NOTE: Combative +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Combative +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="uncanny-animystic-1">Uncanny Animystic</h4>
<p>Some rangers are deeply in touch with the natural world, and have uncanny abilities that are more than mundane.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Amphibious Swimmer</strong>: Because I am amphibious, I may add my Primal capability bonus when I am Focused while swimming. Additionally, while swimming underwater I can hold my breath for an entire scene before having to come up for air.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Danger Sense</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +3 while Quickly Focused to notice things that are dangerous, fast moving, or pose an imminent threat to my safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong>: Because I have natural weapons and am skilled in their use, I may use Focused instead of Combative when my natural weapons are relevant. In situations where it matters I can choose to be treated as attacking barehanded or attacking with a weapon, whichever benefits me more in the situation. Finally, though I can be inconvenienced and my natural weapons can be fouled or restrained, being disarmed is generally off the table for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pass Without Trace</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in the wildlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in wildland areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 2)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="companions-4">Companions</h4>
<p>Rangers often have animal companions; see the <a href="#companions-5">Companions</a> section for details on how to incorporate companions into your character using Stunts.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Animal Companion (-3)</strong>: Because <strong>[describe the reason you have an animal companion]</strong>, I have attracted a powerful animal companion that chooses to aid me.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="animal-companion-4">Animal Companion</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select two.</li>

<ul>
<li>[1][2][3]</li>
<li>Mild (2)</li>
<li>Moderate (4)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ability to share the senses of an animal companion can be useful.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Companion's Senses</strong>: Because I share a mystical bond with my animal companion, I may spend a Fate point to share their senses for a scene at a range of a few dozen miles. This allows me to witness events through the senses of my companion as if I were present. This can be detected by others with appropriate senses as a Quick + Primal overcome action vs a Fantastic (+6) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-9">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="strikers-1">Strikers</h4>
<p>The source material offers rangers as effective melee and ranged combatants.</p>
<p>Rangers are often stereotyped as using bows and arrows, and in later editions of the game due to the influence of a certain popular book character dual-wielding rangers became a thing. But in actuality, a given ranger might prefer sword and board, two-handed weapons, thrown weapons, or whatever.</p>
<h4 id="skill-monger">Skill-monger</h4>
<p>Rangers are skilled, particularly in wilderness settings. They excel at tracking, sneaking around, and surviving in the wilderness, and are also capable hunters.</p>
<h4 id="support-utility-2">Support / Utility</h4>
<p>In addition to being respectable front line combatants, rangers eventually gain some nature magic spells.</p>
<h4 id="pet-1">Pet</h4>
<p>Some rangers get an animal companion.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-8">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The source materials' conception of the ranger has changed over the years, with each new edition of the rules presenting a different take.</p>
<p>The underlying elements of the &quot;ranger&quot; concept have generally included a martially competent, skilled character heavily focused on wildnerness adventuring. Secondary ability to cast nature related spells is also usually a thing as well.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn't feel obligated to adhere to source material; you are free to be creative. Assign your Approach and Archetype bonuses, and define your character's Aspects and Stunts to best realize <em>your</em> &quot;ranger&quot; concept.</p>
<h2 id="the-rogue">The Rogue</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Rogue class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile. Most excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting hazards and conning dull-witted opponents.</p>
<p>Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits. Always one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of a dozen other professions or talents.</p>
<p>Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-13">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Scoundrel</strong>: Roguish +4</p>
<p><strong>Cunning Dodger</strong>: Roguish +3, Focused +1</p>
<p><strong>Thug</strong>: Roguish +3, Combative +1</p>
<p><strong>Learned Sharper</strong>: Roguish +3, Arcane +1</p>
<p><strong>Bandit</strong>: Roguish +3, Primal +1</p>

<p><strong>Bladejack</strong>: Roguish +2, Combative +2</p>
<p><strong>Failed Apprentice</strong>: Roguish +2, Arcane +2</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-10">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>A broad base of competency is a useful trait for many rogues to have; the wide variety of suggested Starting Archetype sets speaks to this diversity.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, rogues are integrally associated with the <strong>Roguish</strong> Archetype. So much so that to be considered a rogue (and not some other hybrid concept), a character should start with at least <strong>Roguish</strong> +2.</p>
<p>However, while a hyper-specialized, dedicated rogue might go all in on <strong>Roguish</strong> +4, it is equally viable to go <strong>Roguish</strong> +3 and take +1 in another Archetype, or <strong>Roguish</strong> +2 and +2 of another Archetype.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> +1 is a very solid and safe choice for a rogue who is sharp of wit, physically fit, perceptive, and quick on their toes. <strong>Focused</strong> +2 works as well, suggesting a character that is both skilled and naturally gifted; well selected Stunts can tie this combination together nicely.</p>
<p><strong>Combative</strong> +1 is a great choice for a deadly rogue who is also skilled in weapon and armor use. <strong>Combative</strong> +2 is also very viable, representing a canny rogue that is also quite skilled at weapons play.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> +1 would be a good choice for a scout or a Rogue who is not a big city slicker. However, dipping deeper into <strong>Primal</strong> will tend to skew a character more towards <a href="#the-ranger">the ranger</a> concept.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> +1 works for a well educated rogue who was tutored or matriculated from a university that taught magical theory (arcana), or dead languages, or other esoteric subjects as a scholastic exercise.</p>
<p>Dabbling in Arcane now at the &quot;basic knowledge&quot; level also allows the use of Scrolls and similar items that require <strong>Arcane</strong> +1.</p>
<p>There's also solid precedent in fiction of a failed wizard apprentice becoming a rogue. Assuming the GM permits the option of a character with <strong>Arcane</strong> +2 knowing a few spells using the guidelines in <a href="#option-a-few-known-spells">Option: A Few Known Spells</a>, taking spells that augment roguish endeavors can work very well for a rogue with a magical edge.</p>
<p>Arcane Tricksters, Spellfilchers, Outlaw Mage, Beguilers, Unseen Seers, Daggerspell Mages, Loredelvers...the source material and third party spin offs are full of hybrid rogue arcanists.</p>
<p>There is a lot of design space here for interesting characters.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Domidar/Domidar.aspx">Domidar</a> started life as a wealthy merchant's son of unusual intelligence. Gifted with a princely education and enrollment in the prestigious College of Mysteries in Absalom, he trained as a wizard for years.</p>
<p>Sadly the winds of fortune blew ill and his family fell into ruin before Domidar completed his studies. Unable to meet the tuition, Domidar was forced out into the cruel world with nothing but his unfinished wizarding training, and his well educated agile mind.</p>
<p>Living since then by his sharp wits, honeyed words, and deniable con artistry, Domidar walks a wily path always chasing some new scheme to 'get it all back'.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 is perhaps the most unusual choice for a Archetype splash but not inappropriate for a rogue who gained his education from a priest or a learning institution affiliated with an organized church.</p>
<p>A rogue might even be a devout servant of a god of thieves. But even if the rogue is not a devout follower of some deity, knowledge of the forces of good and evil or of cosmological concerns or of church politics might be useful in some campaigns.</p>
<h4 id="three-archetype-split">Three Archetype Split</h4>
<p>It is also possible to go with <strong>Roguish</strong> +2 and +1 in two other Archetypes to model a specific concept.</p>
<p>Some mix of <strong>Roguish</strong>, <strong>Combative</strong>, <strong>Focused</strong>, and perhaps <strong>Primal</strong> +1 can all work well.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-10">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Rogues are a diverse lot, and thus all Approaches are equally viable, depending upon what sort of rogue is being represented.</p>
<p>Thieves and other skulkers will favor <strong>Sneaky</strong> of course, and it has been said by some that a good rogue is either <strong>Quick</strong> or dead.</p>
<p>Thuggish rogues can be quite <strong>Forceful</strong>, and swashbuckling adventurers are often <strong>Flashy</strong>.</p>
<p>More urbane and wily rogues tend to be very <strong>Clever</strong>, and all those who deal in traps or poisons or forgeries or anything requiring a steady hand or ice-nerved patience are well advised to be <strong>Careful</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-rogue-exactly">What Kind Of Rogue, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the &quot;rogue&quot; category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<div class="margin-small">
<ol>
<li>Is my rogue a criminal of some kind or are they more of a skilled and resourceful professional?</li>
<li>Is my rogue a specialist in a particular field or skill set, or a generalist?</li>
<li>Is my rogue a self taught loner or were they trained by others?</li>
<li>Is my rouge any good in a conflict, and if so how?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h4 id="criminal-or-professional">Criminal or Professional?</h4>
<p>Despite the stereotype, rogue is not synonymous with thief or criminal. Assuredly, many rogues are indeed guilty of larceny or other illegality, but just as many rogues apply their skills to legitimate ends...or at least stick to the fuzzy edges of the law.</p>
<p>Thus the first question is basically asking if your character is above or below board, how do they make a living, and to what ends do they ply their trade? Deciding where your rogue stands on such matters will greatly inform your allocation of Approaches, choice of other Archetypes, the usual trinity of Concept, Trouble, and Aspects, and of course Stunts.</p>
<p>There is also good dramatic grist to be gained by playing a former criminal trying to go straight, or a normally law abiding citizen being pulled into dirty business.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Eleo/Eleo.aspx">Eleo</a> was born into the lap of criminal luxury, the son of a well established Sczarni crime lord. Raised to take over the &quot;family business&quot;, Eleo knows every trick and con in the book. But Eleo's tragic flaw was that he's actually a decent, honest man with a conscience and integrity.</p>
<p>Parting ways with his larcenous kin, he struck out on his own, seeking a more virtuous path. Though forced to sell his services as a swordsman to make a living, and choosing to not take advantage of his more nefarious skills to turn an easy profit via criminal activity, he seeks to make a new life for himself on the up and up. Of course, fate seems to have other plans for him...</p>
</div>
<h4 id="specialist-or-all-arounder">Specialist or All-Arounder?</h4>
<p>Rogues are all about skill mastery, but which skills and how many skills they attempt to master varies. The second question is asking you to decide what kind of rogue your character will be, or put in simple terms: specialist or generalist?</p>
<p>While the <strong>Roguish</strong> Archetype will do a lot of the heavy lifting as far as mechanical resolutions are required, your choice of High Concept, Trouble, Aspects, Stunts, and whether you go all in on <strong>Roguish</strong> +4 starting out or opt for two or three Archetypes will be where your character differentiates themselves from other rogues.</p>
<p>If you intend to play a specialist rogue, such as a &quot;trapfinder&quot; or a &quot;pickpocket&quot; or a &quot;con artist&quot; or whatever, you'll want to take very specific Aspects and Stunts that precisely dial in your speciality.</p>
<p>If you prefer to play an all-arounder generalist rogue that can adapt to whatever the situation requires, you'll want to take very broad Aspects and Stunts that offer milder but more widely applicable bonuses, or perhaps allow you to use <strong>Roguish</strong> for things that normally require other Archetypes.</p>
<p>::: {.margin-small} :::Description <a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Magala/Magala.aspx">Magala</a> is a dangerous hired killer. A half orc with a dark past, she is a master poisoner, knows her way around a garrote, and is absolutely lethal with throwing stars and knives. And despite her large, powerful frame, she can sneak around like nobody's business.</p>
<p>Magala has honed her stealth, ability to infiltrate places her marks think themselves safe, contacts on the street, and competency with the weapons of an assassin to ensure her ability to succeed in her dangerous line of work. Her skills are justly famed, her street reputation is impeccable, and her very specific services are in high demand. :::</p>
<h4 id="trained-or-self-taught">Trained or Self-Taught?</h4>
<p>The third question is asking you to decide how your character became a rogue, as it should be a key touchpoint in their backstory. How did they learn or develop their amazing skills? Did they just figure things out as they went along, or were they mentored by an experienced rogue? Or perhaps they received formal instruction as part of a guild, or were pressed into service by a kidsman similar to Fagin in Oliver Twist? Did they make any notable allies or enemies along the way?</p>
<p>Whatever your rogue's origin turns out to be, figuring it out will not only help you select abilities and choose Aspects, it will also inform your portrayal of the character, offer motivations and goals, and propel your character forward into emerging storylines.</p>
<p>This is true of coming up with a solid origin story for any kind of character of course, but it is even more essential to rogues as they are the &quot;everyman&quot; niche of fantasy roleplaying.</p>
<p>Unlike the pure fantasy of wizards and clerics, the unacheivable heroic prowess of fighters and barbarians, the unattainable esoteric mastery of monks or bards, characters that are &quot;just&quot; very skilled at doing basically mundane things are much more relatable and thus the story of how they came to be who they are can resonate more authentically.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Draxton/Draxton.aspx">Draxton</a> is a thief's thief. Hardened by the mean streets of Korvosa, he was 'recruited' into the Lightfingers gang as a child and forced to pick pockets and engage in petty crime. But Draxton had natural talent and quickly rose to a prominence as an 'earner'.</p>
<p>In his late teens he went independent, and eventually became known among the underworld of Korvosa as one of the best thieves in the city and lived the dream for a while at the top of his game...until he ran afoul of the Hellknights by stealing the famed Eye of Mareketh. After a close scrape with death Draxton thought it best to leave Korvosa, and set out to find a new home...</p>
</div>
<h4 id="fight-or-flight-1">Fight or Flight?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, conflict is inevitable. Rogues are not oriented around combat, but that doesn't mean that they cannot make their presense felt when things get ugly.</p>
<p>By itself <strong>Roguish</strong> can be used to attack others and defend against attacks with a bit of narrative justification, typically using light weapons such as daggers and short swords, throwing knives, crossbows, and similar &quot;practical&quot; weapons.</p>
<p>A character using <strong>Roguish</strong> to participate in melee combat avoids straight toe-to-toe engagements and instead fights cagey or &quot;dirty&quot;, using the environment and surprise to their advantage. If at all possible most rogues forced to do violence prefer to end the fight quickly with a sneak attack or ambush, because they know that the longer the conflict plays out the more likely they'll get cornered or whacked.</p>
<p>In a prolonged melee fight against an opponent using <strong>Combatives</strong>, the longer the fight goes on the more difficult it will typically get for the rogue to keep coming up with justifications for attacking and defending while being <strong>Roguish</strong>. The nature of the scene set up and clever usage of the create advantage action will determine how easy it is to keep flogging the narrative for justifications, but simple action economy favors an equivalently experienced foe using <strong>Combatives</strong> and the rogue is definitely on a clock.</p>
<p>Fortunately it is relatively easy to level the playing field between <strong>Combatives</strong> and <strong>Roguish</strong> with one or more Stunts such as the following.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dirty Infighter</strong>: Because I am skilled at dirty tricks fighting and getting inside my opponents' guard to strike at vulnerable areas, I am a surprisingly effective combatant. Though my fighting style remains unconventional and evasive, when armed with daggers, light one handed melee weapons such as short swords, garrottes, saps, makeshift weapons, and similar armaments I can use Roguish to directly engage opponents who are using Combative in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shiv</strong>: Because I am skilled with daggers of all shapes and sizes, I may use Roguish as if it were Combatives when fighting with one or more daggers in a conflict, and I inflict +1 stress when I successfully attack while doing so.</p>
</div>
<p>Or a rogue might split between <strong>Roguish</strong> and one of the spellcasting Archetypes, allowing them to potentially make magical attacks.</p>
<p>Ultimately you'll need to decide for yourself if your rogue chooses to avoid conflicts or is otherwise dead weight in a fight, or not, and allocate your Stunts and Archetypes appropriately.</p>
<div class="margin-small">
<div class="description">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Twilla/Twilla.aspx">Twilla</a> is a skilled Trapbuster, with many years of experience and delves into dangerous dungeons and ruins under her diminuitive Halfling-sized belt.</p>

<p>And when need be Twilla is also lethal with a sharp dagger or a precisely aimed acid bomb, able to hold her own even against trained warriors and fearsome monsters.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Can't We Find A Way To 'Work This Out' Non-violently?</strong>: Because I am able to appeal to the baser instincts of most people and appear extremely 'likeable', I'm good at avoiding unwanted conflict and changing the nature of interaction from physical conflict to a mental and social contest.

<p>Some rogues are skilled at violence, or at least know how to handle themselves in dangerous situations.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Ambusher</strong>: Because I am great at setting up ambushes, I gain +1 when I Sneakily set up an ambush or create a related advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Back At You</strong>: Because even my defense is dangerous, whenever I am Quickly Roguish and defend with style against a physical melee attack while wielding a light weapon I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on my attacker, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bushwhacker</strong>: Because I am great at setting up ambushes, I gain +1 when I Sneakily set up an ambush or create a related advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Careful Crossbowman</strong>: Because I am skilled with a crossbow, I gain +2 when I am Carefully Roguish and attack with a crossbow.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dirty Infighter</strong>: Because I am skilled at dirty tricks fighting and getting inside my opponents' guard to strike at vulnerable areas, I am a surprisingly effective combatant. Though my fighting style remains unconventional and evasive, when armed with daggers, light one handed melee weapons such as short swords, garrottes, saps, makeshift weapons, and similar armaments I can use Roguish to directly engage opponents who are using Combative in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fast Attack!</strong>: Because I am shockingly fast, I gain +1 when I am Quickly Roguish and attack. If I inflict a consequence on my target I get an <em>extra</em> free invoke on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Foe Bane</strong>: Because I have a favored enemy Race, when I succesfully attack a target of that Race I inflict +2 shifts of extra stress.

</div>
<div class="description">

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Making It Count</strong>: Because I am able to make my attacks really matter, on an attack that succeeds with style I may spend a fate point to prevent the target from checking a stress box to reduce the stress of the attack. The target may still take consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mobile Strike</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quickly Roguish and attack, if I succeed with style and choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move 1 zone away, as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>One Against Many</strong>: Because I am skilled at defending myself against multiple attackers, I gain +2 to defend when I fight alone against two or more opponents. A single mook defined as a mob counts as being multiple opponents for purposes of this ability as long as there are two or more 'individuals' within the mob. 'Fighting alone' in this context means no allies are in my zone or an adjacent zone, and no ally is aiding me or attacking my opponents.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Passing Attack</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quick and attack, if I choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move one (1) zone away as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shiv</strong>: Because I am skilled with daggers of all shapes and sizes, I may use Roguish as if it were Combatives when fighting with one or more daggers in a conflict, and I inflict +1 stress when I successfully attack while doing so.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sneak Attack</strong>: Because I am good at looking unremarkable or going unnoticed altogether only to launch a deadly and treacherous attack on the unwary, I may add +4 when I am Sneakily Roguish and attack by surprise. If I inflict a Mild or Moderate consequence on my opponent with this attack I may spend a Fate point to bump the consequence from Mild to Moderate or from Moderate to Severe.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sudden Attack</strong>: Because I am prone to sudden violence, I get +2 when I Forcefully attack an opponent who is unaware of my intent.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="competent-professional">Competent Professional</h4>
<p>Some rogues are just good at what they do, deeply competent experts in full command of their craft...whatever that may be.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dungeoneer</strong>: Because I am a seasoned adventurer and dungeoneer, I gain +2 when I am Clever and create advantage or overcome when a item of common adventurer gear that I have proves to be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Nothing Succeeds Like Success (-3)</strong>: <strong>Because nothing succeeds like success, when I succeed with style and gain a boost I may upgrade that boost to a situational Aspect on myself called On A Roll!</strong> with two (2) invokes on it. If the Aspect is already active, I instead add two (2) more free invokes to it. The Aspect is removed at the end of the scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pick Lock, Pocket, Or Number</strong>: Because I am a thief without peer, I gain +2 to overcome when I am Quickly Roguish and attempt to pick a lock or a pocket, or to beat a combination or other form of complex lock.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Poison Master</strong>: Because I am a master at using poisons and have built up resistances to many of them over the years, I may use Roguish to justify attack, defend, create advantage, and overcome actions whenever poisons are relevent. Further, I tend to know or can usually find out with little effort where poisons are bought and sold in urban centers.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skulker</strong>: Because I am so good at escaping notice, I get +2 while I am Sneakily Roguish and create advantage or overcome challenges to avoid notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sublime Expertise (-2)</strong>: Because I am extremely skilled and rarely blunder, whenever I make a 4dF roll I treat any result of less than 0 as -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Thrive Under Pressure</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects to gain a +2 bonus on an action before I roll, if I succeed with style I get the fate point back immediately instead of gaining a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Town And Country Sneaker</strong>: Because I am so good at lurking and being stealthy, I can use Roguish instead of Primal to create advantage and overcome when attempting to avoid being noticed in rural and wildland areas (Roguish is already usable for this in civilized areas).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Trap Sense</strong>: Because I have preternaturally sharp senses and fast reflexes, I gain +1 when I am Quickly Roguish and attempt to notice, overcome, or defend against a trap.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Trapsetter</strong>: Because I am skilled at setting traps, as a non-action I can spend a Fate point to create the situational Aspect <strong>Trapped!</strong> on my zone or up to three (3) zones away with two (2) invokes. The Aspect represents a trap I happened to have set up while no one was looking, or a clever exploitation of the ambient scenery. My traps can take many forms, limited only to things I can narratively justify. I can invoke the Aspect to hinder someone in the affected zone or to help myself or an ally acting against someone in the affected zone. The difficulty for others to notice my trap before the first time it is invoked or to overcome it is equal to my (Clever + Sneaky + Primal) traits if in a wildlands area, otherwise it is equal to my (Clever + Sneaky + Roguish) traits.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Tumbler</strong>: Because I am excellent at acrobatically flipping around and tumbling, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an additional zone and I am unobstructed by minor obstacles that I can tumble around or flip over. If I am in a contest involving me running away from something or avoiding capture, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Universal Linguist</strong>: Because I have a special ability with languages, I can fluently speak and understand any spoken language I encounter.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="slippery-survivor">Slippery Survivor</h4>
<p>Some rogues just manage to scrape out of all manner of hapless situations, whether by skill or luck or a mix of both.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Close Call</strong>: Because I excel at getting out of really bad situations, I can spend a fate point to concede after I already rolled to defend (normally a concession must be made instead of rolling to defend).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Cut And Run!</strong>: Because I am excellent at getting away with it, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move away from danger, I may move two extra zones and I am unobstructed by urban detritus and crowds. If I am in a contest involving me running away or avoiding capture, I gain +2 to overcome while I am Quickly Roguish. This ability only works in urban areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Danger Sense</strong>: Because I am unusually alert and perceptive I gain +3 while Quickly Focused to notice things that are dangerous, fast moving, or pose an imminent threat to my safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fated Fortune</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects I gain a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Impressive Reflexes</strong>: Because I have excellent reflexes, I gain +1 while Quickly attacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Just Roll With It</strong>: Because I excel at avoiding harm and rolling with whatever comes my way, I can use more than one stress box to absorb stress from an attack (normally, only one stress box may be used to offset stress from a single attack).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rogue's Reflexes</strong>: Because I have great reflexes and am able to evade harm better than most people, I may use Roguish to defend against any kind of indirect or surprise attack and to avoid harm by getting out of the way of it. Narratively this can take many forms, such as rolling out of the way, ducking behind cover, 'seeing it coming' and somehow interupting the attack, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Roguish +2 to use.</p>
<p>NOTE: Roguish +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Roguish +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Slip Away (-2)</strong>: Because I am excellent at getting away with it and slipping away unseen, if there is a momentary distraction or opportunity I may spend a Fate point to immediately exit the scene by means appropriate to the narrative such as slippling away into a crowd, or through a hidden door to a secret escape hatch I happened to know about, or by using a magic item I happened to have, etc. I cannot be pursued in the current scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Urban Opportunist</strong>: Because I am so adept at taking advantage of situational opportunities in civilized settlements, I gain +1 when I am Roguish and create advantage or overcome to interact with the area or scene while I am in typical urban areas.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-10">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="skill-mongers">Skill-mongers</h4>
<p>The source material offers rogues as skill-mongers (or &quot;skill monkeys&quot; as you prefer), with both a large skill list and a lot of skill points to apply to them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this doesn't mean as much as it used to due to a major change Pathfinder made from 3.x to class skills vs non-class skills, as well as the consolidation of a number of skills key to the rogue's traditional niche.</p>
<p>Due to these changes, the number of skill points available to rogues is quite superfulous, and classes that get a slightly smaller skill list and slightly fewer skill points are still able to compete with rogues on the skill front.</p>
<p>And oddly, though the flavor text for rogues makes a big deal out of how good they are supposed to be at certain things like being stealthy, or noticing things, or bluffing, or getting into places they should not be, they get no particular mechanical advantage to make it true and are thus no better at it than other classes with overlapping skills.</p>
<h4 id="trap-finders">Trap Finders</h4>
<p>There are also some specific protected niches intended to offer rogues role protection around detecting and disarming traps. But some &quot;archetypes&quot; (as defined by the Pathfinder rule books) for other classes as well as some Traits allow non-rogues to also gain access to this niche, which further erodes the rogue's position.</p>
<p>Also, traps in general tend to be much tamer in Pathfinder than in earlier editions of D&amp;D, greatly lessening the imperative to have a top notch trapbuster in a party.</p>
<h4 id="burst-damage-strikers">Burst Damage Strikers</h4>
<p>In theory rogues are also able to be burst damage strikers thanks to the &quot;sneak attack&quot; mechanic, but in practice their middling attack bonus and severe restrictions on the ability's use makes that less of a reality than the hype suggests.</p>
<h4 id="underpowered">Underpowered</h4>
<p>Due to the many problems with the class, both real and perhaps only perceived, general regard for the rogue class has fallen substantially from the heady days of D&amp;D 3e's release to now.</p>
<p>In fact, the rogue is often cited as being the weakest Pathfinder class, rightly or wrongly. So much so that three different alternate full classes have been released to backstop the gap; the Ninja, the Investigator, and the Slayer.</p>
<h4 id="ninja-investigator-slayer">Ninja / Investigator / Slayer</h4>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated abstracts away from formal classes in favor of broad concepts; thus all class concepts that are thematically tied to the idea of a &quot;rogue&quot; fall within the rogue design space.</p>
<p>Make your character, incorporating ideas as you like, and what you call it is up to you.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-9">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>If you are a fan of the rogue concept, there's good news. First off, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't use a &quot;skill&quot; model; the six Archetypes instead model broad ability sets, a consolidation that favors the rogue compared to the skill dilution of the source material.</p>
<p>Secondly, the source material is sometimes (often?) said to have a &quot;martial caster disparity&quot;, whereby spellcasters are just flat out better than non-spellcasting classes by mid-levels of play.</p>
<p>This is not the case in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated; spellcasters might have an easier time justifying certain ideas, but non-spellcasters correspondingly have an easier time justifying other ideas as well.</p>
<p>And all mechanical outcomes are resolved using the four basic actions of Fate Accelerated; attack, defend, create advantage, and overcome. This baseline, common to both spellcasters and non-spellcasters, prevents a disparity.</p>
<p>These two big points (as well as several secondary nuances) mean that if you decide to play a rogue in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, you'll have a good deal of creative freedom to define your character, the roguish niche of &quot;highly skilled person&quot; will be meaningful, and your rogue will not be rendered obsolete by a spellcasting teammate as your characters advance.</p>
<p>So, go for it. Make the rogue character you envision, free of any class-based doublethink from the source material clouding your perception.</p>
<h2 id="the-sorcerer">The Sorcerer</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Sorcerer class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine.</p>
<p>Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats.</p>
<p>Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts.</p>
<p>While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results.&quot;</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-14">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Eldritch</strong>: Arcane +4</p>
<p><strong>Cryptic</strong>: Arcane +3, Roguish +1</p>
<p><strong>Spellblade</strong>: Arcane +3, Combative +1</p>
<p><strong>Primordial</strong>: Arcane +3, Primal +1</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-11">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> is the only Archetype a sorcerer has to concern themselves with; everything else is optional.</p>
<p>To be considered a sorcerer (and not some other hybrid concept), a character should start with at least <strong>Arcane</strong> +3.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> +3 allows unrestricted spell casting using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guIdeliNes</a>, which you should read first if you are serious about playing a spellcaster. Free casting is the norm in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, so there is no need to concern yourself with &quot;known spells&quot;.</p>
<p>For a standard starting character, this leaves only the decision of where to put the final +1.</p>
<p>A hyper-specialized, dedicated sorcerer will go all in on <strong>Arcane</strong> +4, but putting a +1 into one of the other Archetypes goes a long way towards suggesting a more interesting background for the character.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> +1 is a great choice for a resourceful sorcerer who knows their way around civilized lands, has some people skills, and is familiar with the use of daggers, crossbows, slings, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Combative</strong> +1 is a great choice for a sorcerer who knows which end of a weapon to point towards an enemy. It also opens the door to becoming a <strong>magus</strong> or something similar later on.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> +1 is a less common choice overall, but could make perfect sense for sorcerers of certain bloodlines.</p>
<p>For instance, the aquatic bloodline, boreal bloodline, fey bloodline, elemental bloodline, and verdant bloodline each requires <strong>Primal</strong> +1.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> +1 is a very solid and safe choice for an adaptable sorcerer. Also, it goes well with bloodlines that offer innate physical or esoteric abilities.</p>
<p>For instance, the imperious and destined bloodlines require <strong>Focused</strong> +1.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 is perhaps the most unusual choice, and would most likely be taken purely for concept reasons or something like the celestial bloodline.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-11">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Sorcerers are diverse, and thus all Approaches are equally viable, depending upon what sort of sorcerer is being represented. Sorcerers are ultimately great individualists, and thus they defy easy stereotyping. Having said that, many sorcerers are <strong>Flashy</strong> with their overt magic and strange bloodlines.</p>
<p>Blasting sorcerers will tend to favor <strong>Flashy</strong> or <strong>Forceful</strong>, while the more charming sort opt for <strong>Sneaky</strong> or <strong>Clever</strong>.</p>
<p>Some sorcerers are <strong>Careful</strong>, or <strong>Quick</strong> but not in any statistically normative ways.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-sorcerer-exactly">What Kind Of Sorcerer, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the sorcerer category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What role do I want my sorcerer to fill?</li>
<li>Does my sorcerer have a bloodline, and if so how significant is the bloodline overall?</li>
<li>Does my sorcerer focus more on spellcasting or on other abilities?</li>
<li>Is my sorcerer a swiss army knife spellcaster or does their magic have a theme?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="role-2">Role?</h4>
<p>A sorcerer can be individualized to fill a variety of roles, and you get to decide what role you want your sorcerer to attempt to fill.</p>
<p>You might intend for your sorcerer to be optimized for conflicts. Or perhaps you want to play more of a smooth operator who opts for more subtle resolutions via stealth, guile, and / or charm. Or you might want your sorcerer to be a problem-solver or &quot;support&quot; character who is either specialized to address a particular niche or generalized to have a broad range of &quot;utility&quot; allowing them to adapt to emerging challenges that the group might face in their adventures. And of course, your sorcerer might attempt to fill more than one role or not be intentionally designed to fit any particular role as you prefer.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Voxel/Voxel.aspx">Voxel</a> is a cryptic cypher who reveals little of what he is actually thinking, possesses an imperative air of command with expectations of immediate obedience, and shows a callous disregard for the feelings of others.</p>
<p>Voxel's arcane mastery is impressive; he focuses his magic via Words of Power uttered by his darkly mellifluous voice, and few things can stand between him and his goals for long. Voxel is a leader, not a follower, and he knows how to get things done. He takes no more risks than are necessary, but he is well prepared for conflict. Voxel is also well practiced at influencing the minds of others as necessary to get what he wants.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="bloodline-or-no-bloodline">Bloodline Or No Bloodline?</h4>
<p>You should decide if you want your character to have bloodline oriented abilties, or drop the concept altogether as you prefer.</p>
<p>If you do want to incorporate a bloodline concept into your sorcerer, you can use one of the bloodlines described in the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-%20classes/sorcerer/bloodlines">source material</a> for inspiration or come up with your own idea.</p>
<p>If you do opt for a bloodline, it will probably influence your High Concept.</p>
<p>You may also want to anchor your bloodline concept with at least one Stunt. Alternately you might choose one of the <a href="#bloodline-stunts">bloodline stunts</a> provided as examples, which bundle thematic Stunts together.</p>
<p>And finally, you might also incorporate your bloodline into your Trouble; for instance a person of Abyssal bloodline might experience complications in their life.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Ilsa/Ilsa.aspx">Ilsa</a> is a survivor of the <strong>Worldwound</strong>, descended from a once mighty family of lost <strong>Sarkoris</strong>, and inheritor of potent boreal magics with a deep affinity for cold and ice.</p>
<p>Ilsa's people have fought tirelessly in the ensuing years in the Mendevian Crusades, vainly struggling to push back the tide of evil seeping into the world.</p>
<p>The wars have ground her family to dust and bones; Ilsa is the last alive and she has had enough, abandoning the futile dream and seeking a new future elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="pure-spellcaster-or-thematic-hybrid">Pure Spellcaster Or Thematic Hybrid?</h4>
<p>The third question is about refining your character concept; it will mostly influence your choice of Archetypes and your Stunt selections.</p>
<p>If a bloodline is an important part of your character concept and you want to take some thematic abilities as Stunts and perhaps slide a +1 into a Archetype other than <strong>Arcane</strong>, it will make your sorcerer more interesting and distinctive but it does reduce your sorcerer's focus on spellcasting.</p>
<p>Of course, this decision is relevant even for sorcerers that eshew the bloodline concept. There are all sorts of interesting directions to explore with the design of an individual sorcerer, but finding a balance between spellcasting potency and other abilities is key.</p>
<h4 id="generic-generalist-spellcaster-or-conceptual-specialist">Generic Generalist Spellcaster Or Conceptual Specialist?</h4>
<p>The fourth question is asking you to think about what kind of spells your sorcerer can cast. Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't impose restrictions on your spell choices; if your character has a high enough <strong>Arcane</strong> Archetype you are allowed to attempt to cast any spell you want unless the GM says no.</p>
<p>However, it can be a lot more rewarding and fun to self-impose a theme or shtick to your sorcerer and attempt to solve problems while staying within it. This can inspire you to creativity, and make your sorcerer seem a lot more interesting. Consider giving it a try.</p>
<p>Alternately you may prefer to have a list of known spells to operate from for convenience; not everyone is comfortable with coming up with things on the fly and that's ok. Feel free to make a list of known spells with write-ups and run with it, but remember that it is just a list of convenience and not a restriction that you can't deviate from.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Royce/Royce.aspx">Royce</a> is a dangerously curious trickster, burglar, mountebank, and Gnome-about-town who uses illusions and deceit in the course of his daring heists and cons. His inability to do anything in a direct and honest way leads to all sorts of unlikely misadventures.</p>
<p>While he does know a bare handful of general purpose spells, it is Royce's mastery of illusions that defines his magic use. His illusions range from the simple to the elaborate, and the ease with which he slips them into place in the most innocuous of ways makes it very difficult for any unsuspecting victims to know for sure what is real and what is not when they are in Royce's vicinity.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="stunts-13">Stunts</h3>
<p>Sorcerer characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#arcanist-stunts">Arcanist Stunts</a>, <a href="#special-stunts">Special Stunts</a>, <a href="#innate-stunts">Innate Stunts</a>, <a href="#bloodline-stunts">Bloodline Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some sorcerers.</p>
<p>However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong>: Because I have mastered protecting myself with magic, I may use Arcane to defend against physical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Archery</strong>: Because I am an Arcane Archer, when I am Cleverly Arcane and use a bow and arrow I get +2 when I attack and the attack is considered to be magic rather than mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Arcane Bolts</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of Arcane Bolts, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Arcane and attack with ranged magic.</p>

<p><strong>Arcane Senses</strong>: Because I have developed my arcane senses to impressive heights, I may use Arcane instead of Focused to notice or perceive things and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Chained Lightning</strong>: Because I am able to project a bolt of lighting that jumps from target to target, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fireburst</strong>: Because I am able to cause a mystical explosion to occur, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all targets in up to two contiguous adjacent zones without having to split my shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heed Me!</strong>: Because I have a magical knack that allows me to augment my spoken voice with enchanting magics I may use Arcane for social interactions if I can talk and my target can hear me. I am resisted by Arcane when I do so. This is a form of mind-affecting magic.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Levitation</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of mystic levitation, while I am Flashily Arcane I may attempt to overcome a Superb (+5) difficulty to create the situational Aspect <strong>Levitating</strong> on myself. While this Aspect is in play I may levitate; while levitating I am unaffected by obstacles that I can levitate over, and I can hover out of easy reach of the ground thus frustrating melee attackers. This Aspect can be overcome by appropriate magic, with a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I cannot invoke the Aspect for any additional benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Reverberation</strong>: Because I know many Words of Power, if I am currently able to speak as a non-action I may spend a Fate point to utter a Word and immediately remove from play any one situational Aspect in my zone or an adjacent zone with a difficulty of Legendary (+8) or less to overcome. Though there is no 4dF roll involved, I am considered to be acting in a Flashily Arcane manner when I do this and the reverberations of the Word are very noticeable.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Scroll Scrivener</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of scribing scrolls, I can be Cleverly Arcane and prepare 'spell completion' items as scrolls or similar items for specific spell effects that I can cast. I can later cast the inscribed spell (using the simple magic system guidelines) from the item, gaining a bonus in the process. Other characters with Arcane +1 or better can also use my scrolls. I can also stockpile unused scrolls, as well as use scrolls inscribed by others. Unless explicitly denied means and opportunity, I can prepare a number of new scrolls ready for use equal to my Arcane capability each day.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shocking Touch</strong>: Because I am able to generate a magical paralyzing shock, I may use Arcane instead of Focused when fighting barehanded or grappling.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Illusionist</strong>: Because I am skilled at using my illusions to hide the truth, I get +2 when I am Arcane and create an advantage using illusion magics to deceive.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per scene if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per exchange if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>

<h4 id="bloodlines">Bloodlines</h4>
<p>The <a href="#bloodline-stunts">Bloodline Stunts</a> section contains write-ups are provided for a handful of bloodlines. It is important to note that these are not intended as &quot;the one true way&quot; to model bloodlines; they are purely suggestions.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible, and valid, to model bloodlines in different ways up to and including allowing a High Concept or Aspect to fully represent all nuances of the idea via a combination of narrative support, the create advantage action, and fate points.</p>
<p>But, there is much to be gained by opting for a more concrete representation as well.</p>
<p>Each bloodline bundles together several Stunts and usually one or more Archetype or Approach requirements. Ideally a character using the bloodline will take the full set at character creation, but it is also possible to just cherry-pick individual items.</p>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-11">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="support-utility-3">Support / Utility</h4>
<p>The source material offers sorcerers as full casting utility characters with an array of options including buffing, debuffing, and control spells.</p>
<h4 id="blaster">Blaster</h4>
<p>A sorcerer can serve as a blaster, loading up on ranged damage spells.</p>
<p>There is a point of view among Pathfinder grognards that blasting is not an optimal strategy for a full arcane caster, but it can be a fun way to go nonetheless and it is the rare sorcerer who doesn't have at least one or two ranged damage spells.</p>
<h4 id="bloodlines-1">Bloodlines</h4>
<p>Sorcerers are able to choose a bloodline in the source material, from which their innate magical abilities manifests. Each bloodline offers some thematic abilities, and they provide a significant way to individualize sorcerers.</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-10">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The sorcerer is a solid and flexible class in the source material...indeed, it is often considered to be among the most powerful base classes in the game. But Pathfinder Fate Accelerated offers even more flexibility to personalize your sorcerer to make a character that is as distinctive as they are capable.</p>
<p>Free casting is the default in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, so there is no need to worry about &quot;known spells&quot; for your sorcerer. Decide what kind of effects are appropriate for your sorcerer to cast, and self-police on any urges to cast spells that don't make sense per your character's shtick.</p>
<p>You are free to personalize your sorcerer with abilities suited to a concept such as a bloodline. As a player interested in expressing their creativity you should first check with your GM to determine what they will and wont allow.</p>
<p>You can also opt to dispense with the idea of a bloodline altogether, and just make a straight up arcane spellcaster with no frippery.</p>
<h4 id="bloodlines-as-charcter-concepts">Bloodlines as charcter concepts</h4>
<p>The source material added in the concept of bloodlines to differentiate sorcerers from wizards, and to round out the class with interesting thematic abilities. This addition made sense, as the idea of bloodlines is internally consistent with the source material's premise that sorcerers are born with an inherited connection to magic.</p>
<p>The addition of sorcerous bloodlines in the source is a feature that offers a mechanical solution to a class differentiation problem, and also a conceptual solution by anchoring a premise that was previously stated to be true in D&amp;D 3e but was meaningless as anything other than a roleplaying suggestion due to being pure fluff.</p>
<p>In Pathfinder Fate Accelerated the mechanical impetus for bloodlines offers no relevance or benefit.</p>
<p>This leaves only the conceptual facet of bloodlines, and thus the decision to incorporate a bloodline into your character is one based entirely upon your character concept.</p>
<p>If a particular bloodline helps you to realize your character concept, take it.</p>
<p>If the bloodline idea is not relevant to your character concept, ignore the entire idea of bloodlines and make the character you want to play.</p>
<h2 id="the-summoner">The Summoner</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Summoner class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning monsters from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more skilled at it than the summoner. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a close bond with one particular outsider, known as an eidolon, who gains power as the summoner becomes more proficient at his summoning.</p>
<p>Over time, the two become linked, eventually even sharing a shard of the same soul. But this power comes with a price: the summoner's spells and abilities are limited due to his time spent enhancing the power and exploring the nature of his eidolon.&quot;</p>
<p>From the perspective of Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, summoners are just arcane spellcasters with an extra-fancy familiar.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended that players interested in making a summoner type character refer to the <a href="#the-sorcerer">the Sorcerer</a> or <a href="#the-wizard">the Wizard</a> or <a href="#the-witch">the Witch</a> as a baseline, and allocate some number of Stunt slots towards having a companion.</p>

<h3 id="approach-considerations-12">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Careful</strong> and <strong>Sneaky</strong> are useful Approaches for summoners.</p>

<p>The following Stunts might be of interest to a summoner.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Companion's Senses</strong>: Because I share a mystical bond with my animal companion, I may spend a Fate point to share their senses for a scene at a range of a few dozen miles. This allows me to witness events through the senses of my companion as if I were present. This can be detected by others with appropriate senses as a Quick + Primal overcome action vs a Fantastic (+6) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Conjurer</strong>: Because I am skilled at using conjurations for summoning minions to do by bidding, I get +2 when I am Arcane and overcome using conjuration magic to summon a servitor.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="companions-5">Companions</h4>
<p>Summoners have an eidolon, which is a powerful companion; see the <a href="#companions-5">Companions</a> section for details on how to incorporate companions into your character using Stunts.</p>
<p>The sample Animal Companion below demonstrates the starting baseline for such a companion at the cost of three Stunt slots; however as described in the <a href="#companions-5">Companions</a> section, it is possible to allocate even more Stunt slots to such a companion to make them more powerful.</p>

<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-11">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>Unlike the core classes which have some amount of prior existence or precedence in D&amp;D lore, the Summoner class was created wholesale for Pathfinder.</p>
<p>The name might suggest some kind of specialist in <strong>Conjuration</strong> magics, and that is true in a broad sense. However, the Summoner class goes further and offers a concept called an <strong>eidolon</strong>, which is a sort of build-your-own pocket monster.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to make very powerful combat capable eidolons, and to further abuse the rules via some &quot;archetypes&quot; (as defined in the Pathfinder rulebooks) and feats to produce what many consider to be a grossly overpowered character. So much so that some GM's outright ban the Summoner class from their games.</p>
<p>Further, as Summoners were introduced later the class is not well integrated into the default setting of Golarion overall, (though there are a few exceptions), which leaves it rather weak from a fiction perspective.</p>
<p>As Pathfinder Fate Accelerated is far more concerned with concepts than mechanics, the concept of Summoners offers little to distinguish itself from the basic idea of a arcane caster with a really pumped up familiar. However, individual players and GM's can overcome this by finding ways to more seamlessly integrate the Summoner concept into their campaigns if they so desire.</p>
<h2 id="the-witch">The Witch</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Witch class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power.</p>
<p>Communing with that source the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
<p>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of their mysterious powers.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>The advice given in <a href="#the-sorcerer">the Sorcerer</a> or <a href="#the-wizard">the Wizard</a> (if you prefer the <strong>Prepared Casting</strong> model) class translation sections is directly relevant to witches, and you should refer to them for general ideas. This section concentrates on content that might be of particular interest to witches.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Ruelga/Ruelga.aspx">Ruelga</a> is an enchantingly beautiful Jadwiga hailing from the land of Irrisen, but has left the cold and barren hills of her birth to find a life apart from her twisted family and pursue her own studies into the nature of magic.</p>
<p>Older than she seems, Ruelga is a descendant of the legendary Baba Yaga, and heir to ancient and somewhat primitive but dangerously insidious magics.</p>

<p><strong>Eldritch</strong>: Arcane +4</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong>: Arcane +3, Primal +1</p>
<p><strong>Mystic</strong>: Arcane +1, Primal +3</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-13">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p>Technically, the only Archetype a witch needs is <strong>Arcane</strong>. However, a lot of the abilities normally proscribed to witches in fiction fall between <strong>Arcane</strong> and <strong>Primal</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, it is recommended (but not required) that you at least consider splashing <strong>Primal</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="labels">Labels</h4>
<p>Witch is both a concept and a label. Feel free to use a different term for your character if you wish. Whether your character calls themselves witch, warlock, wyrd, shaman, wise man, or whatever is up to you.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Moek/Moek.aspx">Moek</a> was a spirittalker of the proud Kaurannock, a tribe of far off Arcadia. However his village was raided and he, along with many others, were taken by Chelaxian slavers.</p>
<p>After a harrowing series of travails that resulted in most of those taken from his village dying of hardships and the rest scattered to different buyers, Moek eventually found himself on the other side of the world where he was put on display in a carnivale along with other &quot;curiosities&quot; as an example of an &quot;Arcadian Savage&quot; for the amusement of decadent Chelaxians. But after some weeks of this debasement his new owners eventually grew lax, and Moek was able to affect an escape.</p>
<p>He now finds himself alone in a strange land, with nothing but his magic.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="patrons">Patrons</h3>
<p>The source material has the concept of very vaguely defined witch &quot;patrons&quot; which putatively are the source of a witch's abilities. This is a rather odd conceit from a fiction standpoint, and mechanically primarily serves to offer specific spells that are not normally on the witch spell list. It means nothing in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated terms due to the lack of spell lists and thus this idea can be dropped entirely, or incorporated into a character's concept via Aspects and / or Stunts as you prefer. A patron might even manifest itself in a character's Trouble, if it compels their behavior.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Tamara/Tamara.aspx">Tamara</a> is a seithr of the Linnorm lands consumed by <strong>vengeance</strong>. Beautiful and used to getting what she wants, Tamara takes it personally when she does not, and has a tendency to act on her frustrations. She reserves her greatest ire for those who have spurned her, however.</p>
<p>Accordingly she has left the land of her birth to hunt down and punish the loutish Linnorm warrior Leofric Haversen who had the temerity to reject Tamara's overtures of wedlock, and then added to the offense by fleeing to warmer climes to get away from her. Such an insult cannot go unanswered.</p>

<p>The following Stunts might be of particular interest to a Witch.</p>
<h4 id="hexes-and-charms">Hexes and Charms</h4>
<p>Some witches have one or more spell-like magical abilities.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Disenchant</strong>: Because I am adept at dispelling persistent magical effects, I gain +2 while Arcane to overcome situational Aspects put into play via any kind of magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Evil Eye</strong>: Because I can hex others with the power of the Evil Eye, I gain +2 while Arcanely creating advantage to attach the spell Aspect <strong>The Eye Is Upon You</strong> to a person or creature in my zone that I can see. This spell Aspect lasts until it has no more invokes remaining or it is overcome. Anyone in the scene may invoke this Aspect to penalize or interfere with the target's actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bestow Curse</strong>: Because I am skilled at afflicting others with curses, I get +2 while Arcanely creating advantage by using my magic to put a situational Aspect representing a curse or other temporary magical impediment on a living sentient person or creature. The difficulty to overcome one of my curses with appropriate magic is equal to my (Arcane + Primal) bonuses; the target can also overcome the curse themselves while Carefully Focused but the difficulty is +1 higher. There is no zone restriction on this ability, but I must be able to see my target, and I cannot move zones in the same exchange that I use this ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per scene if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per exchange if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Levitation</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of mystic levitation, while I am Flashily Arcane I may attempt to overcome a Superb (+5) difficulty to create the situational Aspect <strong>Levitating</strong> on myself. While this Aspect is in play I may levitate; while levitating I am unaffected by obstacles that I can levitate over, and I can hover out of easy reach of the ground thus frustrating melee attackers. This Aspect can be overcome by appropriate magic, with a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I cannot invoke the Aspect for any additional benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Mastery (Hideous Laughter)</strong></p>
<p>Because I have mastered the <strong>Hideous Laughter</strong> spell, whenever I am being Arcane and gain a boost I may use that boost to add two (2) additional free invokes to any <strong>Hideous Laughter</strong> situational Aspects that I have put into play (if any).</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="hideous-laughter">Hideous Laughter</h6>
<p>Arcane Spell (Enchantment), Compulsion, Mind-Affecting</p>
<p>Create advantage while Flashily Arcane vs an Average (+1) difficulty to create a spell Aspect on a target within my zone or an adjacent zone called <strong>Hideous Laughter!</strong> for one (1) scene or until all invocations are used.</p>
<p>While this Aspect is active the victim is afflicted with fits of uncontrollable laughter, falling prone and becoming unable to attack or create advantage or move while madly laughing.</p>
<p>Anyone attacking or acting against the target may invoke this Aspect against the victim to take advantage of their condition.</p>
<p>This spell only affects living, sentient targets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sudden Slumber</strong>: Because I have mastered a magical talent from olden times, once per session I can put any number of nameless mooks who lack consequence slots in my zone or an adjacent zone to sleep. I may affect additional contiguous zones by spending a Fate point per additional zone. To do this I must use Carefully Arcane to create the advantage <strong>Sleep Now My Pretties</strong> against an Average (+1) difficulty. Those affected will sleep artificially deeply, and resist being woken for the remainder of the scene; someone trying to wake a victim must overcome a difficulty equal to Average (+1) plus my margin of success.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Willful Invisibility</strong>: Because I can turn invisibile at will, if I do not attack or create advantage in an exchange I may place the situational Aspect <strong>'Invisible'</strong> on myself as a free action that takes no time before or after my normal action. If I attack or create advantage while invisible, this Aspect is immediately removed and I become visibile for at least one (1) exchange before I am able to use this ability to become invisible again. My innate invisibility can be temporarily neutralized by those with unusual senses or magic or special items creating an applicable advantage; the difficulty to do so is Superb (+5). It can also be overcome and thus removed by some abilities that explicitly counter invisibility or dispel magic; the difficulty to do so is Fantastic (+6).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Will To Power</strong>: Because my will to push forward to victory is absolute, once per session I may gain +4 when attempting to overcome any one (1) situational Aspect in my zone or an adjacent zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Witch's Fire</strong>: Because I can sicken others with magical energies, while Flashily Arcane I suffer a -1 penalty to attack one or more targets in my zone with a blast of eerie mystical energies, but if I split shifts between multiple targets the targets each suffer a -1 penalty to defend against my attack. If I succeed with style against any of the targets in all cases I must reduce the stress to get a boost, but the boost is automatically upgraded to the situational Aspect <strong>Sickened</strong> with two (2) invokes, which is attached to the affected target. This Aspect is automatically invoked at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress to the target per invoke as the magical attack continues to linger; the target cannot defend against this additional stress but may apply any resistances or protection they have such as damage reduction or immunity to magic.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="bubble-bubble-toil-trouble">Bubble Bubble Toil &amp; Trouble</h4>
<p>Some witches make potions, poultices, poisons, or other such concoctions. They might even make some stuff that's a little more directly dangerous. Also, some witches are immune to poisons.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Prepared Caster (Alchemy Dabbler)</strong></p>
<p>Because I am a capable dabbler in the esoteric science of Alchemy, given time and opportunity I may 'prepare' a number of potions, elixirs, salves and similar 'concoctions' equal to [(Careful + Arcane)]{.no-wrap}.</p>
<p>Unused concoctions remain until they get activated or destroyed and can be stockpiled. These Aspects are portable; [I may]{.no-wrap} give them to others and they can be taken away from me.</p>
<p>Making a concoction requires time, materials, and either a lab or a field kit; the specifics are left to the GM's discretion, but simple potions might take minutes while very powerful potions might take one or more hours.</p>
<p>If a strict economy is being enforced in the campaign, it usually costs about half retail price to make a concoction; GM's discretion applies.</p>
<p>To prepare a concoction I roll 4dF and add Arcane against a Mediocre (+0) difficulty; failure indicates a botched concoction and that 'slot' is wasted for the day. I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the concoction I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepared concoctions are activated by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the effect of the concoction using the previously rolled margin of success. It is possible for a concoction resolution to fail if the margin of success is insufficient to the difficulty or if opposed successfully. If I am the activator, I can spend a Fate point at this time to add +2 shifts to the margin of success.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<p><em>Commodities</em></p>
<p>Alchemical concoctions can be given, sold to, or stolen by others and used by them. They are effectively a commodity.</p>
<p>However all of an alchemist's concoctions, including those under another character's control, count against their preparation limit.</p>
<p><em>Alchemical Item Write-ups</em></p>
<p>A variety of write-ups for [sample alchemical items] and [sample potions] are available. Each usage of these kinds of alchemical items counts against an alchemist's preparation limit.</p>
<p>Note that the provided write-ups are just examples, and not a restricted list of allowed effects; an alchemist can make any sort of alchemical item the GM allows.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Potions, Poultices, Poisons</strong>: Because I know ancient lores from more primitive times, I am able to brew potions, poultices, and poisons that can harm and heal and work odd and subtle magics on those who imbide them. I can be Cleverly Arcane and make substances that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. At any given time I can have a number of substances brewed up and ready for use equal to my Arcane + Primal capability.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Alchemical Bombs</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later throw alchemical bombs.</p>
<p>When I am Cleverly Focused I gain +1 to throw a bomb into my zone or an adjacent zone, generally against an Average (+1) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful, my bomb explodes and inflicts a number of shifts of damage equal to my (Careful + Arcane) against every target in the zone without splitting shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of alchemical bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can not catalyze my bombs, they are only usable by me.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use. :::</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Poison</strong>: Because I am immune to poison, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on poison.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="bewitching">Bewitching</h4>
<p>Some witches excel at charming or controlling the minds or emotions of others, particularly the weak willed. And some are also good at protecting their own mind and emotions from the abilities of others.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Domination (-2)</strong>: Because of my mastery of mind-affecting enchantments, while I am Forcefully Arcane I can make mental attacks against a living target in my zone or an adjacent zone. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against the target's nature. If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Beauty</strong>: Because I am adept at using subtle enchantments to magically enhance my beauty, I may add my Arcane capability as a bonus to any social interaction where my appearance can be a factor; however this can be resisted by Arcane and is a Mind-Affecting effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Empathy</strong>: Because I am a master of enchantment magics that allow me to manipulate the emotional states of others, while I am Cleverly Arcane I can engage a target in a social conflict and if I inflict a Consequence I can afflict them with a propensity for a specific emotion. Consequences such as <strong>Fits Of Uncontrollable Rage</strong>, <strong>Plunged Into Deep Sadness</strong>, <strong>Gripped By Passionate Love</strong>, and <strong>Overwhelmed By Euphoric Happiness</strong> incite those afflicted to act out in ways appropriate to the emotional state I have imposed on them. If, while I share a scene with the target, a Consequences I have inflicted with this ability is compelled and the target spends a fate point to refuse the compel, I gain the fate point immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Immune To Mind-Affecting</strong>: Because I am immune to mind-affecting abilities, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on mental coersion or disorientation.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="old-magic">Old Magic</h4>
<p>Some witches combine both Arcane and Primal magics, keeping alive a more ancient tradition of spellcasting that deals in primordial forces, animism, crude necromancy, and control over the natural world.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Living Off The Land</strong>: Because I am adept at surviving off of what nature offers me, I am always able to find enough food and water to keep myself and a couple of other people or animals healthy while in wildlands and rural areas (i.e. above ground and not near a city or town). Additionally if I've had at least half a day to become familiar with the terrain in a specific area of wilderness I gain +1 on all actions while being Primal. How large the area of wilderness might be is left to the GM's discretion, but it should be at least five square miles.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Necromantic Enervation</strong>: Because I am a master of necromancy, I am able to drain the life energy from others. While I am Sneakily Arcane I can attack others with 'Life Draining' spells; in addition to the stress if I inflict a Consequence on my target I afflict them with enervation and ennui. Consequences such as <strong>Easily Fatigued</strong>, <strong>Fits Of Ennui</strong>, <strong>Prone To Depression</strong>, and <strong>Sunk Into A Deep Funk</strong> cause those afflicted to struggle to motivate and empower themselves, to unexpectedly lose interest in being active, become unconcerned about succeeding in their endeavors, and so forth. If a target is taken out in this way, they die and rise again as an Undead minion that I can control for the remainder of the scene and possibly longer at the GM's discretion.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wild Shape (-2)</strong>:</p>
<p>Because I have the ability to change into the form of any normal animal of my choice, I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form.</p>
<p>When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). This lasts for an entire scene unless I choose to return to normal, which ends the effect. Additionally, I may spend another Fate point to assume a different animal's form, and I do not have to first change back to normal.</p>
<p>When I change forms I gain an additional Aspect named for the animal form I have assumed which I can invoke when my current animal form is relevant, and which can be compelled whenever my animal form or lack of humanoid anatomy might inconvenience me.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has natural weapons I may use Focused in place of Combatives while in a physical conflict.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>

<p>Bonded familiars offer a lot of value for their Refresh equivalency, but also pose a dire threat to their owners should they be killed as their lifeforce is bound to their owner's lifeforce.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Familiar (Bonded)</strong>: Because I have a mystical familiar I am always accompanied by an animal that is particularly smart and capable for its kind.

<p>The ability to share the senses of a familiar can be useful.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Companion's Senses</strong>: Because I share a mystical bond with my animal companion, I may spend a Fate point to share their senses for a scene at a range of a few dozen miles. This allows me to witness events through the senses of my companion as if I were present. This can be detected by others with appropriate senses as a Quick + Primal overcome action vs a Fantastic (+6) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="bloodlines-2">Bloodlines</h4>
<p>Some witches get their magic from their heritage, inheriting their powers from an arcane bloodline.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Accursed Bloodline (-5)</strong>:</p>
<p>This bloodline requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
<p>This bloodline requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</li>
<li><strong>Evil Eye</strong>: Because I can hex others with the power of the Evil Eye, I gain +2 while Arcanely creating advantage to attach the spell Aspect <strong>The Eye Is Upon You</strong> to a person or creature in my zone that I can see. This spell Aspect lasts until it has no more invokes remaining or it is overcome. Anyone in the scene may invoke this Aspect to penalize or interfere with the target's actions.</li>
<li><strong>Forbidding Presence</strong>: Because I present a very intimidating and stern visage while emanating a frightenting aura, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize.</li>
<li><strong>Forced Dementia</strong>: Because I have the ability to afflict the minds of others with mental confusion and temporary insanity, I gain +1 while Arcane to create advantage on a foe within my zone to place the situational Aspect <strong>Demented Confusion</strong> upon them. The recipient may be compelled by the GM or other players to do bizarre and illogical (but not suicidal) things. The Aspect lasts for a scene but can be overcome via appropriate magic as a Superb (+5) difficulty challenge. The recipient themselves can also overcome the Aspect while Carefully Focused as a Fantastic (+6) difficulty challenge. This is a mind-affecting ability.</li>
<li><strong>Damage Reduction</strong>: Because I am more durable than normal, I reduce by one (1) all stress inflicted on me by physical and magical attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fey Bloodline (-5)</strong>:</p>
<p>This bloodline requires Sneaky +1 and Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
<p>This bloodline requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</li>
<li><strong>Pass Without Trace</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in the wildlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in wildland areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 2)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Willful Invisibility</strong>: Because I can turn invisibile at will, if I do not attack or create advantage in an exchange I may place the situational Aspect <strong>'Invisible'</strong> on myself as a free action that takes no time before or after my normal action. If I attack or create advantage while invisible, this Aspect is immediately removed and I become visibile for at least one (1) exchange before I am able to use this ability to become invisible again. My innate invisibility can be temporarily neutralized by those with unusual senses or magic or special items creating an applicable advantage; the difficulty to do so is Superb (+5). It can also be overcome and thus removed by some abilities that explicitly counter invisibility or dispel magic; the difficulty to do so is Fantastic (+6).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wild Shape (-2)</strong>: Because I have the ability to change into the form of any normal animal of my choice, I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form.</p>
<p>When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0).

<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Verdant Bloodline (-5)</strong>:</p>
<p>This bloodline requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
<p>This bloodline requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</li>
<li><strong>Plant Traits</strong>: Because of my verdant nature, I am immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun. However I take +1 shift of stress from attacks that rely on cold, fire, acid, or are described as being especially effective vs plant life.</li>
<li><strong>Pass Without Trace</strong>: Because of my mastery of the natural world, I gain +1 when I am Sneakily Primal while in the wildlands, I am unobstructed by undergrowth, and if I take a full move I may move three zones instead of two. Finally, tracking me in wildland areas is very difficult; those attempting it must overcome a difficulty equal to my <strong>((Sneaky + Primal) * 2)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Barkskin Knack</strong>: Because I have a minor magical knack, I can create advantage while Carefully Primal vs an Average (+1) difficulty to apply the Aspect <strong>Barkskin</strong> to myself. While this Aspect is active I gain +2 when defending against physical or damaging magical attacks. This Aspect may also be invoked to offer additional protection when defending from physical or magical harm. This Aspect can be overcome and removed as a Superb (+5) difficulty by those with Primal +3 or higher.</li>
<li><strong>Entangling Undergrowth</strong>: Because I am a master of natural magics, when I am in a rural area with vegetation, while I am Carefully Primal I may attempt to overcome a Great (+4) difficulty to cause the undergrowth in my zone or an adjacent zone to animate and wrap itself around and entangle all targets. See the Entangling Undergrowth profile for details. I am immune to this effect.</li>

<h3 id="source-material-notes-13">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-12">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The witch is a solid and flexible class in the source material. However, the Pathfinder presentation of a witch is very specific and narrowly defined from both a fluff and a design perspective, which can present problems for those who prefer a different spin on the witch concept. But Pathfinder Fate Accelerated offers a lot more latitude to personalize a witch...or warlock, or whatever term you prefer.</p>
<h5 id="prepared-casting-vs-free-casting">Prepared Casting vs Free Casting</h5>
<p>Free casting is the default in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, and you are not required to limit yourself to the prepared caster model unless you want to.</p>
<h5 id="sorcerer-wizard-witch">Sorcerer / Wizard / Witch</h5>
<p>The mechanical differentiation in the source material between Arcane primary casters does not exist in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<p>You are free to blend concepts as much as you like and apply whatever label you want to the result.</p>
<h2 id="the-wizard">The Wizard</h2>
<p>This section provides suggestions and insights into how to translate the ideas of the Wizard class from the source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<div class="flavor">
<p>&quot;Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible---such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might.</p>
<p>Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals.</p>
<p>While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic.</p>
<p>In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="starting-archetype-sets-17">Starting Archetype Sets</h4>
<p><strong>Eldritch</strong>: Arcane +4</p>
<p><strong>Cryptic</strong>: Arcane +3, Roguish +1</p>
<p><strong>Spellblade</strong>: Arcane +3, Combative +1</p>
<p><strong>Failed Apprentice</strong>: Arcane +2, Roguish +2</p>
<p><strong>Gish</strong>: Arcane +2, Combative +2</p>
</div>
<h3 id="archetype-considerations-14">Archetype Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> is the only Archetype a wizard has to concern themselves with; everything else is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong> +3 allows unrestricted spell casting using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guIdeliNes</a>, which you should read first if you are serious about playing a spellcaster.</p>
<p>However, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated offers the <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> option for those who prefer the idea of wizards needing to prepare or memorize a finite number of spells per day.</p>
<p>To be considered a wizard, a character who is taking the <strong>Prepared Casting Stunt</strong> should start with at least <strong>Arcane</strong> +2; characters who prefer to free cast spells should start with at least <strong>Arcane</strong> +3.</p>
<p>Going with <strong>Arcane</strong> +4 is a powerful choice, but splashing another Archetype also yields benefits and can go a long way towards anchoring various concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Roguish</strong> +1 or +2 is a great choice for a resourceful wizard who knows their way around civilized lands, has some people skills, and is familiar with the use of daggers, crossbows, slings, and the like.</p>
<p>There is a lot of synergy to be had between <strong>Roguish</strong> and <strong>Arcane</strong>, and it is hard to go wrong with this choice.</p>
<p><strong>Combative</strong> +1 or +2 is a great choice for a wizard who knows which end of a weapon to point towards an enemy. It also opens the door to becoming a magus or something similar later on.</p>
<p><strong>Primal</strong> +1 or +2 can work for certain concepts. Primal plus Arcane lends itself more towards <a href="#the-witch">the witch</a> and elementalists than wizards, but something like a &quot;hedge wizard&quot; or wise man could work.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> +1 is a very solid and safe choice for an adaptable wizard. However <strong>Focused</strong> +2 doesn't offer much additional benefit for a wizard and is probably not worth it for anything other than concept reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong> +1 or +2 is perhaps the most unusual choice, and would most likely be taken purely for concept reasons, such as something like the <strong>Mystic Theurge</strong> idea from the source material.</p>
<h3 id="approach-considerations-13">Approach Considerations</h3>
<p>Almost all wizards are <strong>Clever</strong>, indeed a sharp mind and prodigious intelligence is a defining characteristic of the concept of wizards. Many wizards are also <strong>Careful</strong>, preferring to thoroughly study or ponder and to act with ritualistic precision.</p>
<p><strong>Abjurers</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Quick</strong> and <strong>Forceful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conjurers</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Careful</strong> and <strong>Forceful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Diviners</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Careful</strong> and <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Enchanters</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Flashy</strong> and <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Invokers</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Flashy</strong> and / or <strong>Forceful</strong> and / or <strong>Quick</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Illusionists</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Quick</strong> and <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Necromancers</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Careful</strong> and <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Transmuters</strong> will tend to favor <strong>Forceful</strong> and <strong>Sneaky</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-wizard-exactly">What Kind Of Wizard, Exactly?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when defining a character in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated that you envision falling into the wizard category, you might start out by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does my wizard use the Prepared Casting model or not?</li>
<li>Does my wizard focus more on spellcasting or on other abilities?</li>
<li>Is specialization in a school of magic an important facet of my wizard?</li>
<li>What role do I want my wizard to fill?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="prepared-or-not-prepared">Prepared Or Not Prepared?</h4>
<p>As mentioned previously, Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows unrestricted spell casting using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">simple magic guIdeliNes</a>. However, the <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> option is provided for those who prefer the idea of wizards needing to prepare or memorize a finite number of spells per day.</p>
<p>You are not required to limit yourself to the prepared casting model unless you want to. &quot;Wizard&quot; is just a label that can be applied to a character that does not use the prepared casting option as easily as it can be applied to a character that does. If you decide to go this route, you might want to check out <a href="#the-sorcerer">the sorcerer</a> class translation as well.</p>
<p>If you do decide to use the prepared casting option, there are some measurable benefits to it. Perhaps most significantly for a starting character, prepared casters get a large bonus to apply to spells they have prepared and can thus be quite potent despite their relatively small number of spells per day.</p>
<p>If you are using the prepared casting model, you might want to look at some of the write-ups of <a href="#sample-spells">sample spells</a> to help you pick a list of known spells.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Amarzedrin/Amarzedrin.aspx">Amarzedrin</a> is a mage who is determined to one day be recognized as an archwizard. However, he's paid a steep price in the number of years spent dedicated to academic study, and his real-world experience is lacking. Book smart but not streetwise, his theoretical understanding of the world does not always withstand the more pragmatic necessities of reality.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Amarzedrin and his allies, his broad education and diverse studies have provided a plethora of options for solving problems with...assuming he prepared the right spell for the problem at hand.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="pure-spellcaster-or-thematic-hybrid-1">Pure Spellcaster Or Thematic Hybrid?</h4>
<p>Are you planning to play a dedicated wizard, or do you intend to go for a hybrid by splashing some wizardly magic onto some other concept. This decision will mostly influence your choice of Archetypes and your Stunt selections.</p>
<p>In Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, characters using the Prepared Casting model do have an edge over free casters when it comes to hybrid concepts, due to the allowance to cast spells with <strong>Arcane</strong> +2 rather than needing to have <strong>Arcane</strong> +3 to gain spellcasting.</p>
<p>Even though a prepared caster with <strong>Arcane</strong> +2 does not get very many spells per day, the spells they do get are reasonably potent.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Domidar/Domidar.aspx">Domidar</a> started life as a wealthy merchant's son of unusual intelligence. Gifted with a princely education and enrollment in the prestigious College of Mysteries in Absalom, he trained as a wizard for years.</p>
<p>Sadly the winds of fortune blew ill and his family fell into ruin before Domidar completed his studies. Unable to meet the tuition, Domidar was forced out into the cruel world with nothing but his unfinished wizarding training, and his well educated agile mind.</p>
<p>Living since then by his sharp wits, honeyed words, and deniable con artistry, Domidar walks a wily path always chasing some new scheme to 'get it all back'.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="specialization-or-no-specialization">Specialization Or No Specialization?</h4>
<p>In the source material there's no good reason for a wizard to not be a specialist as they gain significant mechanical advantages. However, that is not true in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated; the choice to specialize or not is purely a matter of character concept with no mechanical effect.</p>
<p>However deciding to specialize does offer a lot of character development opportunities, providing a strong theme to build a character around. Certain specializations also lend themselves better to certain roles, and thus choosing to incorporate a school specialization will tend to have an impact on how your character interacts with others and what niche they are able to fill for an adventuring party.</p>
<p>If you do opt for a specialization, it will probably influence your High Concept. You will probably also want to anchor your specialization with at least one Stunt.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated doesn't try to force you to comply with your own character concept, thus there's no such thing as a forbidden or opposed school. It is entirely up to you whether you want to incoporate such an idea into your character, and to self-police yourself to comply with it if you do. However you could incorporate the idea of an opposed school into your Trouble if you wanted to.</p>
<div class="Example">
<p><a href="/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/Characters/Iconics/Javina/Javina.aspx">Javina</a> is a young wizardess, a legacy member of the <strong>Pathfinder Society</strong> trained from childhood by semi-retired adventurer parents.</p>
<p>Particularly skilled at divinations and abjurations, Javina is a capable and well prepared professional with several successful delves under her belt. Her magic provides her with a myriad of tools for solving problems and supporting party members.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="role-3">Role?</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful attribute of a universalist wizard, sometimes known as a <strong>mage</strong>, is that on any given day they can fill just about any given role. With a wise selection of spells, such a character is the ultimate toolbox utility character.</p>
<p>Specialists give up some of that flexibility, but gain the benefits of focusing on particular facets of magic.</p>
<p><strong>Abjurers</strong> are all about defense and can serve as tanks of a sort, nullifying magic, repulsing opponents, using globes of invulnerability, as well as buffing their buddies to be more tankish with various protective magics. Wards and glyphs also allow an abjurer with time to set up magical traps.</p>
<p><strong>Conjurers</strong> excel at summoning minions to serve them, and thus can potentially fill any role as they can summon up a creature that is suited to the job at hand. They are particularly adept at vicariously fulfilling the Striker and Tank roles. A variety of conjuration effects also provide battlefield control, such as entanglers and large cloud effects.</p>
<p><strong>Diviners</strong> excel at gaining information which allows them to make especially good use of create advantage to discover Aspects. They are also often able to predict the near future to both avoid attacks as well as know when and where it is most auspicious to strike.</p>
<p><strong>Enchanters</strong> can excel as a &quot;face&quot;, controlling social situations. They can also use their magics to control sentient opponents, allowing for a soft form of battlefield control.</p>
<p><strong>Illusionists</strong> excel at deception and control. Some illusionists can also use their magic to aid them in social encounters by seeming to be someone else or altering a mark's perception of reality. They can also manage some battlefield control by tricking opponents into tactical or strategic blunders.</p>
<p><strong>Invokers</strong> excel at ranged striking, blasting opponents with powerful magics. They can also mount a potent defense with walls of force and similar constructs, and they have excellent battlefield control via various walls and spells that have large areas of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Necromancers</strong> excel at debuffs and some buffs (though often of a grotesque nature). They also often have powerful and insidious attacks, and can control undead minions to do their bidding.</p>
<p><strong>Transmuters</strong> are the kings of buffing. They also have a lot of decisive all-or-nothing effects such as disintegrate and offensive polymorph spells that have the potential to entirely alter the nature of an encounter in a single moment. :::</p>
<h3 id="stunts-16">Stunts</h3>
<p>Wizard characters might find the following Stunt categories of interest: <a href="#arcanist-stunts">Arcanist Stunts</a>, <a href="#special-stunts">Special Stunts</a>.</p>
<p>The following Stunts are offered as samples that might be relevant for some wizards.</p>
<p>However, the best Stunts are those that are tailor made to fit your concept, so don't hesitate to come up with your own or work with your GM to define something that is &quot;just right&quot; for your character. See the <a href="#stunt-options">Stunt Options</a> section for ideas on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="arcane-senses">Arcane Senses</h4>
<p>Many (but not all) wizards are amazingly observant and are even able to see arcane forces, which greatly aids them in their magic.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Senses</strong>: Because I have developed my arcane senses to impressive heights, I may use Arcane instead of Focused to notice or perceive things and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use. :::</p>
</div>
<h4 id="school-specialization">School Specialization</h4>
<p>Some wizards focus on a particular &quot;school&quot; or sub-grouping of magic, developing their skills with such spells to high levels of ability.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Diviner's Warning</strong>: Because my skills with divination magics are very advanced, I can use Arcane instead of Focused to notice things that could harm me and I gain +2 to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Abjurer</strong>: Because I am skilled at using abjurations to nullify magic, I get +1 when I am Arcane and defend or overcome using abjuration magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Conjurer</strong>: Because I am skilled at using conjurations for summoning minions to do by bidding, I get +2 when I am Arcane and overcome using conjuration magic to summon a servitor.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Diviner</strong>: Because I am skilled at using divinations to know the unknown, I get +1 when I am Arcane and create advantage or overcome using divination magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Enchanter</strong>: Because I am skilled at using enchantments to bend others to my will, I get +1 when I am Arcane and create advantage or overcome using enchantment magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Illusionist</strong>: Because I am skilled at using my illusions to hide the truth, I get +2 when I am Arcane and create an advantage using illusion magics to deceive.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Invoker</strong>: Because I am skilled at using evocations to wreak mayhem, I get +1 when I am Arcane and attack using evocation magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Necromancer</strong>: Because I am skilled at using my necromancy, I get +1 when I am Arcane and create advantage or attack using necromantic magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Skilled Transmuter</strong>: Because I am skilled at using transmutations to change the fundamental nature of things, I get +1 when I am Arcane and create advantage or overcome using transmutation magic.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="spell-mastery">Spell Mastery</h4>
<p>Some wizards develop their skill with a particular spell to such heights that they no longer need to prepare it. Additionally, such abilities are often personalized to suit the wizard's style or idiom.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong>: Because I have mastered protecting myself with magic, I may use Arcane to defend against physical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Domination (-2)</strong>: Because of my mastery of mind-affecting enchantments, while I am Forcefully Arcane I can make mental attacks against a living target in my zone or an adjacent zone. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against the target's nature. If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Bolts</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of Arcane Bolts, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Arcane and attack with ranged magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Chained Lightning</strong>: Because I am able to project a bolt of lighting that jumps from target to target, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Disenchant</strong>: Because I am adept at dispelling persistent magical effects, I gain +2 while Arcane to overcome situational Aspects put into play via any kind of magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Beauty</strong>: Because I am adept at using subtle enchantments to magically enhance my beauty, I may add my Arcane capability as a bonus to any social interaction where my appearance can be a factor; however this can be resisted by Arcane and is a Mind-Affecting effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Empathy</strong>: Because I am a master of enchantment magics that allow me to manipulate the emotional states of others, while I am Cleverly Arcane I can engage a target in a social conflict and if I inflict a Consequence I can afflict them with a propensity for a specific emotion. Consequences such as <strong>Fits Of Uncontrollable Rage</strong>, <strong>Plunged Into Deep Sadness</strong>, <strong>Gripped By Passionate Love</strong>, and <strong>Overwhelmed By Euphoric Happiness</strong> incite those afflicted to act out in ways appropriate to the emotional state I have imposed on them. If, while I share a scene with the target, a Consequences I have inflicted with this ability is compelled and the target spends a fate point to refuse the compel, I gain the fate point immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fireburst</strong>: Because I am able to cause a mystical explosion to occur, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all targets in up to two contiguous adjacent zones without having to split my shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heed Me!</strong>: Because I have a magical knack that allows me to augment my spoken voice with enchanting magics I may use Arcane for social interactions if I can talk and my target can hear me. I am resisted by Arcane when I do so. This is a form of mind-affecting magic.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Levitation</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of mystic levitation, while I am Flashily Arcane I may attempt to overcome a Superb (+5) difficulty to create the situational Aspect <strong>Levitating</strong> on myself. While this Aspect is in play I may levitate; while levitating I am unaffected by obstacles that I can levitate over, and I can hover out of easy reach of the ground thus frustrating melee attackers. This Aspect can be overcome by appropriate magic, with a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I cannot invoke the Aspect for any additional benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mana Bolts</strong>: Because I am able to launch target-seeking magical bolts, when I am Cleverly Arcane and attack I may spend a Fate point <em>or</em> suffer the Mild Consequence <strong>Spell Fatigue</strong> to affect all enemy targets in an adjacent zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Necromantic Enervation</strong>: Because I am a master of necromancy, I am able to drain the life energy from others. While I am Sneakily Arcane I can attack others with 'Life Draining' spells; in addition to the stress if I inflict a Consequence on my target I afflict them with enervation and ennui. Consequences such as <strong>Easily Fatigued</strong>, <strong>Fits Of Ennui</strong>, <strong>Prone To Depression</strong>, and <strong>Sunk Into A Deep Funk</strong> cause those afflicted to struggle to motivate and empower themselves, to unexpectedly lose interest in being active, become unconcerned about succeeding in their endeavors, and so forth. If a target is taken out in this way, they die and rise again as an Undead minion that I can control for the remainder of the scene and possibly longer at the GM's discretion.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Reverberation</strong>: Because I know many Words of Power, if I am currently able to speak as a non-action I may spend a Fate point to utter a Word and immediately remove from play any one situational Aspect in my zone or an adjacent zone with a difficulty of Legendary (+8) or less to overcome. Though there is no 4dF roll involved, I am considered to be acting in a Flashily Arcane manner when I do this and the reverberations of the Word are very noticeable.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Shocking Touch</strong>: Because I am able to generate a magical paralyzing shock, I may use Arcane instead of Focused when fighting barehanded or grappling.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per scene if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per exchange if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="magical-crafting">Magical Crafting</h4>
<p>To augment and complement their spellcasting some wizards dip into alchemical arts, while others make an abundance of scrolls, and yet others craft some other minor magical items.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Prepared Caster (Alchemy Dabbler)</strong></p>
<p>Because I am a capable dabbler in the esoteric science of Alchemy, given time and opportunity I may 'prepare' a number of potions, elixirs, salves and similar 'concoctions' equal to <strong>(Careful + Arcane)</strong>.</p>
<p>Unused concoctions remain until they get activated or destroyed and can be stockpiled. These Aspects are portable; [I may]{.no-wrap} give them to others and they can be taken away from me.</p>
<p>Making a concoction requires time, materials, and either a lab or a field kit; the specifics are left to the GM's discretion, but simple potions might take minutes while very powerful potions might take one or more hours.</p>
<p>If a strict economy is being enforced in the campaign, it usually costs about half retail price to make a concoction; GM's discretion applies.</p>
<p>To prepare a concoction I roll 4dF and add Arcane against a Mediocre (+0) difficulty; failure indicates a botched concoction and that 'slot' is wasted for the day. I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the concoction I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepared concoctions are activated by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the effect of the concoction using the previously rolled margin of success. It is possible for a concoction resolution to fail if the margin of success is insufficient to the difficulty or if opposed successfully. If I am the activator, I can spend a Fate point at this time to add +2 shifts to the margin of success.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
<p><em>Commodities</em></p>
<p>Alchemical concoctions can be given, sold to, or stolen by others and used by them. They are effectively a commodity.</p>
<p>However all of an alchemist's concoctions, including those under another character's control, count against their preparation limit.</p>
<p><em>Alchemical Item Write-ups</em></p>
<p>A variety of write-ups for [sample alchemical items] and [sample potions] are available. Each usage of these kinds of alchemical items counts against an alchemist's preparation limit.</p>
<p>Note that the provided write-ups are just examples, and not a restricted list of allowed effects; an alchemist can make any sort of alchemical item the GM allows.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Scroll Scrivener</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of scribing scrolls, I can be Cleverly Arcane and prepare 'spell completion' items as scrolls or similar items for specific spell effects that I can cast. I can later cast the inscribed spell (using the simple magic system guidelines) from the item, gaining a bonus in the process. Other characters with Arcane +1 or better can also use my scrolls. I can also stockpile unused scrolls, as well as use scrolls inscribed by others. Unless explicitly denied means and opportunity, I can prepare a number of new scrolls ready for use equal to my Arcane capability each day.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="strange-magics">Strange Magics</h4>
<p>Some wizards practice unusual variations or alternate traditions of arcane magic.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Archery</strong>: Because I am an Arcane Archer, when I am Cleverly Arcane and use a bow and arrow I get +2 when I attack and the attack is considered to be magic rather than mundane.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="familiar-1">Familiar</h4>
<p>Wizards sometimes have animal companions as familiars; see the <a href="#companions-5">Companions</a> section for details on how to incorporate companions into your character using Stunts.</p>
<p>Bonded familiars offer a lot of value for their Refresh equivalency, but also pose a dire threat to their owners should they be killed as their lifeforce is bound to their owner's lifeforce.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Familiar (Bonded)</strong>: Because I have a mystical familiar I am always accompanied by an animal that is particularly smart and capable for its kind. However, the life force of my familiar is bound to my own. If my familiar is slain I immediately take a Severe Consequence <strong>Severed Familiar Bond</strong> and I cannot gain a new familiar until this consequence has been cleared.</p>
<div class="description">

<p>Proxy familiars offer a lot of value for their Refresh equivalency and allow their owners to extend the range at which they can use various abilities, but also pose a challenge to their owners should they be killed as they are the repository of their owner's known spells.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Familiar (Proxy)</strong>: Because I have a mystical familiar I am always accompanied by an animal that is particularly smart and capable for its kind. However, my familiar is the repository of all my known spells and if they are killed I cannot cast Arcane spells until I get a replacement familiar.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ability to share the senses of a familiar can be useful.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Companion's Senses</strong>: Because I share a mystical bond with my animal companion, I may spend a Fate point to share their senses for a scene at a range of a few dozen miles. This allows me to witness events through the senses of my companion as if I were present. This can be detected by others with appropriate senses as a Quick + Primal overcome action vs a Fantastic (+6) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="prepared-casting-1">Prepared Casting</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Fate Accelerated allows free casting by default, but some players might prefer their wizard to be a Prepared Caster; see <a href="#prepared-casting">prepared casting</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="source-material-notes-14">Source Material Notes</h3>
<h4 id="support-utility-4">Support / Utility</h4>
<p>The source material offers wizards as full casting utility characters with an array of options including buffing, debuffing, and control spells.</p>
<h4 id="blaster-1">Blaster</h4>
<p>A wizard can serve as a blaster, loading up on ranged damage spells.</p>
<p>There is a point of view among Pathfinder grognards that blasting is not an optimal strategy for a full arcane caster, but it can be a fun way to go nonetheless and it is the rare wizard who doesn't have at least one or two ranged damage spells.</p>
<p>In Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, blasting usually amounts to just using the Arcane Archetype in conjunction with the attack action. Some characters might also take one or more Stunts related to using Arcane to attack.</p>
<h4 id="specialization">Specialization</h4>
<p>Wizards are able to choose a school specialization in the source material, which offers extra spells and thematic benefits related to a specific &quot;school of magic&quot; (Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, Transmutation).</p>
<h4 id="diverging-from-source-material-13">Diverging From Source Material</h4>
<p>The wizard is a solid and flexible class in the source material...indeed, it is often considered to be among the most powerful base classes in the game. But Pathfinder Fate Accelerated offers even more flexibility to personalize your wizard to make a character that is as distinctive as they are capable.</p>
<h5 id="prepared-casting-vs-free-casting-1">Prepared Casting vs Free Casting</h5>
<p>Free casting is the default in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated, and you are not required to limit yourself to the prepared caster model unless you want to. You can use the free casting model and just apply the &quot;wizard&quot; label.</p>
<h5 id="sorcerer-summoner-witch">Sorcerer / Summoner / Witch</h5>
<p>The mechanical differentiation in the source material between Arcane primary casters does not exist in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated.</p>
<p>You are free to blend concepts as much as you like and apply whatever label you want to the result.</p>

<li><strong>Constructed Senses (-2)</strong>: Because I perceive the world via magical sensors, I can see perfectly in total darkness, even if I am 'blinded'. Additionally, I can sense invisibile things that are near me; I gain +2 to overcome any Aspect related to invisibility or a similar effect within my zone.</li>
<li><strong>Constructed Resistances (-4)</strong>: Because I am a construct I am immune to death effects, disease, mental effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and energy drain. I also don't need to breathe and never get tired.</li>
<li><strong>Immune To Magic (-2)</strong>: Because I am immune to almost all magic, I am unaffected by any malign effect that relies on magic. The exception to this is that I am not immune to magic that explicitly affects or manipulates metal (and similar effects), and electricity based effects.</li>
<li><strong>Made Of Metal (-2)</strong>: Because I am made of metal, I reduce by 2 all stress inflicted on me by acid, cold, fire, force, and physical attacks. However metal-affecting magics not only ignore this resistence, they gain a +2 bonus when used against me.</li>
<li><strong>Still As A Statue</strong>: Because I am able to pose as an ornamental statue, unmoving for as long as I care to be, I get +2 when I create advantage or overcome challenges to avoid notice if I am immobile and posed appropriately. In most scenes, if I am already in an area and posed appropriately I will already have the situational Aspect <strong>'Just A Statue'</strong> on myself which I am assumed to have succeeded with style to create and thus have two (2) invokes on it.</li>
<li><strong>Ambusher</strong>: Because I am so good at ambushing my prey, if I am able to surprise an opponent I gain +4 to attack in the first exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Sentinel Alarum</strong>: Because I am a construct designed to be a remote sentinel, when I perceive an intrusion in the area I have been programmed to guard, I trigger a telepathic magical alarm which alerts my operator to the intrusion, including basic details of the intruders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not treat as a mob; each Sentinel acts as an individual.</p>
<p>Cast from metal in the form of a large humanoid head, this creature perches on six sharp and spidery mechanical legs, its eyes intermittently shining with an orange glow.</p>
<p>Thassilonian Sentinels cannot be summoned; they must be created via a time consuming process that is almost entirely lost to history.</p>

</ul>
<p>The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist---certainly not traits unusual in the demons, yet the babau's penchant for stealth and surprise sets it apart from its generally less-subtle kin. With no need to eat (although most babaus relish the flavor of mortal meat on their thin, raspy tongues), a babau can wait in ambush for years or decades---their inhuman patience in anticipating a well-conceived murder also setting them apart from the other denizens of the Abyss.</p>
<p>Babaus obsess over the act of killing and take great pride in their grisly art, often leaving behind some form of grim marker or obscure signature, whether it be a distinctive modus operandi, an unnerving token, or other profane evidence.</p>
<p>A babau typically carries a longspear or other weapon with which it can strike at foes beyond its normal reach, but given the opportunity, a babau prefers to fight with its teeth or claws. The foul, caustic sludge that constantly seeps from their flesh prevents them from wearing armor unless it is specially treated or resistant to acid.</p>
<p>A babau is 6 feet tall but weighs only 140 pounds. They form from mortal souls of lone killers---those who, in life, took pleasure in more personal and intimate murders. Loosed upon the Material Plane, a babau often finds itself in the same role, haunting the shadowy corners of the world as remorseless assassins.</p>

<p>Norgorber (pronounced NOR-gore-ber) is known as a deity of thievery and assassination, as well as a keeper of secrets. He is called the 'Reaper of the Reputation' by some, but he has more insidious titles among his other worshipers. He remains an enigma to most, and his true motives are unknown. Many of his own followers remain ignorant of his plans and designs. Norgorber is the only evil aligned god amongst the Ascended.</p>
<p>Norgorber's worshipers come from all walks of life and all of them are termed Sons and Daughters of the Mask; many are clerics, rogues, bards and assassins. Most followers of Norgorber will choose one of his Four Aspects to particularly worship.</p>
<p>The most extreme are numbered among the murderous insane, who commit atrocities in his reverence. The followers of the cult of <strong>Father Skinsaw</strong> are known as the Skinsaw Men or the Skinsaw Cult. Spies and politically minded folk who worship him as the <strong>Reaper of Reputation</strong> consider him the deity of secret knowledge, such as the Ustalavic organization called the Anaphexia. Thieves revere the <strong>Gray Master</strong>. Assassins, alchemists and herbalists follow <strong>Blackfingers</strong>.</p>
<p>Norgorber's ceremonial colours are black and brown. The cultist's clothes usually follow modern fashions, in order to blend in wherever they are.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrificer of Norgorber</strong></p>
<p>Norgorber is a sinister but complex diety. Among the four sects dedicated to him, the fourth attracts the most extreme and murderously insane, who commit atrocities as acts of worship to 'Father Skinsaw'. The followers of this cult are known as the Skinsaw Men. The Skinsaw cult is a centuries-old organization originating in Vyre, Cheliax and their methods tend to involve kidnapping sacrificial victims as well as random murders of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Socialite of Norgorber</strong></p>
<p>Norgorber is a sinister but complex diety. Known as the 'Reaper of Reputation' (among other less circumspect terms), some of his worshipers are spies and power hungry politicos and social climbers who consider Norgorber the deity of secret knowledge and ascension to prominence and influence via a more left handed path. Such followers blend in among society, pursuing the collection of secrets, leverage, and other means to exert influence for their own aggrandizement. Their weapons are blackmail, slander, lies, and when it comes to it poison.</p>

<h3 id="sczarni">Sczarni</h3>
<p>The Sczarni are a loose collection of Varisian crime families, operating primarily in the cities and towns of Varisia, but found wherever significant numbers of Varisians gather.</p>
<p>Sczarni focus is on the less violent crimes such as robbery, pickpocketing, and confidence schemes, and generally target only non-Varisians. They believe that this affords them the maximum profit with minimum risk.</p>
<p>They may be driven out of town, beaten, jailed, or even mutilated, but rarely is a Sczarni put to death for his or her crimes. Their activities are notorious enough, however, that they have greatly contributed to the racial stereotype of Varisians as untrustworthy thieves. Being independently minded in the extreme, one Sczarni family will have next to nothing in common with another, other than their occupation, cultural background, and general methods.</p>
<p>Most Varisians are opposed to the Sczarni and want nothing to do with them. They believe that their activities invite trouble and further stereotyping against their kind. Despite this opinion, most Varisians will offer aid to a Sczarni who is in trouble, especially when outsiders are involved.</p>

<li><strong>Plant Traits</strong>: Because of my verdant nature, I am immune to mind- affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun. However I take +1 shift of stress from attacks that rely on cold, fire, acid, or are described as being especially effective vs plant life.</li>
<li><strong>Necrotic Touch (-4)</strong>: Because my tentacles have the ability to instantly whither and rot a living creature's flesh to the bone with a mere touch, I gain +8 to attack a target in my zone and consequences inflicted by me tend to involve massive permanent scarring, whithered limbs, and similar major physical maiming.</li>
<li><strong>Slow Movement (+3)</strong>: Because I am only able to travel very slowly, it takes me three exchanges to move one zone and I may not move and attack in the same exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to five (5) Violet Fungi will form a mob. Add three (3) hit boxes and +1 to attack with Necrotic Touch for each additional Violet Fungus.</p>
<p>A violet fungus feeds on the rot and decay of organic matter, but unlike most fungi, they are not passive consumers of corruption. A violet fungi's tendrils can strike with unexpected swiftness, and are coated with a virulent venom that causes flesh to rot and decay with nauseating speed.</p>
<p>This potent poison, if left untreated, can cause the flesh of an entire arm or leg to drop away in no time at all, leaving behind only warm bones that soon rot into corruption as well.</p>
<p>The violet fungus is one of the most notorious and feared dangers of the world's caves. A traveler can often see signs of the violet fungus in those who dwell or hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. In these folk, deep and hideous scars mar bodies where entire furrows of flesh seem scooped away---the marks of a close encounter with a violet fungus. Although violet fungi are mobile, they only move to attack or to hunt for prey.</p>
<p>A violet fungus that has a steady supply of rot to sup upon is generally content to remain in one place. Many underground-dwelling cultures take advantage of this penchant, particularly troglodytes and vegepygmies, and keep multiple violet fungi in key junctions and entrances to their caverns as guardians, making sure to keep them well fed with carrion to prevent them wandering farther into the den in search of food.</p>

<h2 id="potions">Potions</h2>
<p>Potions are very common and popular magical items allowing people with no magical ability whatsoever to benefit from frequently powerful and useful magical abilities. Potions are a commodity, and also can be vulnerable to breakage and theft. But this does little to detract from their value due to their sheer practicality.</p>
<p>These alchemical items can take many forms ranging from oils, salves, dusts, powders, and other such concoctions. However, liquid intended to be injested is by far the most common form and thus 'potion' is used as a general term.</p>
<p>Potions are essentially magical spells trapped in a concoction of some kind, but unlike Scrolls, Wands, and other similar items they can generally be used by anyone and are thus of much broader utility. Potions typically have a flat pre-set effect and thus offer a dependable but inflexible benefit. The effects of Potions are also typically very easy to dispel.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="scrolls-1">Scrolls</h2>
<p>Scrolls are basically spells trapped on paper just waiting to be cast by a knowledgeable user.. Scrolls require at least +1 in an applicable spell casting Archetype to use.</p>
<p>When a character uses this sort of Scroll, they are actually casting the spell using the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a>. Scrolls generally grant a flat +4 bonus if they require a specific Approach and Archetype combination be used while casting, or a +2 bonus if they only require a Archetype and can be used with any Approach.</p>
<p>However, and this is important, preparing a Scroll for use takes an action. Thus to cast a spell from a Scroll requires an action to get it out and prepare to use it, and an action to use it. Thus the large bonus is factored against the loss of action economy.</p>
<p>A character can declare that they are preparing a Scroll before a conflict starts if they had reason to believe that it would be adviseable to do so and had time to prepare in the scene leading up to the conflict. This indicates that the Scroll is out and opened (or on display) and the character is poised to cast from it.</p>

I can Carefully overcome against a Fair (+2) difficulty to retrieve anything I've explicitly put into it; failure just means I have to keep rooting around looking for the item with additional actions.

If I am able to use it prior to a social encounter to prepare a room or chamber, I gain (+1) to all subsequent social actions I take within the prepared area. The benefit of the effect lasts for several minutes after the box is closed, unless a strong wind or something similar clears the incense from the room. Mystical senses can detect the subtle magic by overcoming an Epic (+7) challenge, and it can be suppressed with dispelling magics for a scene by overcoming a Superb (+5) challenge.</p>

<h6 id="immovable-rod">Immovable Rod</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flat Iron Bar</li>
<li>Moderately Magical (Transmutation)</li>
</ul>
<p>This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed the rod anchors itself in its current position and will not budge, even if staying in place defies gravity.</p>
<p>Thus the owner can lift or place the rod wherever they can reach, push the button, and let go leaving the rod anchored in place. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are strictly necessary).</p>
<p>The magic of one immovable rod can support up to five tons before catastrophically failing, causing the rod to deactivate and cease working. However, multiple immovable rods might be used in tandem to support more weight.</p>
<p>Despite the seeming incongruity with the name it actually is possible to move an activated immovable rod by overcoming a Wondrous (+10) challenge while being Forcefully Focused. Success allows the rod to be moved up to a foot, and each additional shift allows another three feet of distance. The rod will remain in its new location after being moved in this way. Of course this is largely irrelevant as a person with the ability to manipulate the rod could simply turn it off, move it to the desired location, and then turn it back on.</p>

<p><strong>Maiden's Helm (-2)</strong>: Because I wear a magical helmet that radiates intimidating and frightenting emanations, I gain +1 when being Forceful and attempting to frighten or demoralize. Additionally it confers greater power a few times per day.</p>

<p><strong>Orb of Consumption</strong>: Because I have a magical Orb of Consumption, its special magical abilities aid me in my adventures.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="orb-of-consumption">Orb of Consumption</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Head-sized Hollow Sphere</li>
<li>Mind-Affecting, Sonic</li>
<li>Strongly Magical (Enchantment)</li>
</ul>
<p>This cruel device could not seem less intimidating---it appears as nothing more frightening than a hollow sphere of pink glass the size of a halfling's head. When it is held in both hands and its command word is spoken, a pulsing light throbs at the core of the sphere and the sound of an ongoing exhalation of breath emanates from the orb.</p>
<p>This effect lasts for as long as the user concentrates, spending their entire turn to keep the orb activated.</p>
<p>Each turn that the user concentrates on keeping the orb activated, every other character in their zone must overcome an Epic (+7) challenge; or a Superb (+5) challenge if being Carefully Focused. Characters who succeed can take their action as normal. Those who fail are compelled to use their action to approach and touch the orb. Characters compelled in this way may spend a Fate point to resist the effect and take their action this turn as normal.</p>
<p>The orb itself inflicts an Epic (+7) magical attack on anyone other than its user who fails to resist the orb's lure and makes physical contact with the orb. The attack takes the form of enervating magic that saps a victim's life force.</p>
<p>If the orb inflicts a consequence on any of its victims, it places the spell Aspect <strong>Consumed Lifeforce</strong> on its user, or adds an additional free invoke to the Aspect if it already exists. This Aspect can be invoked by the orb's user whenever they are being Focused to improve their chances of success.</p>
<p>The <strong>Consumed Lifeforce</strong> spell Aspect can be removed using appropriate magic by overcoming an Epic (+7) difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Wayfinder</strong>: Because I own a Wayfinder, I am able to employ a useful magical tool to help me in my adventures. See the Wayfinder write up for details.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="wayfinder">Wayfinder</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Faintly Magical (Evocation)</li>
<li>Fancy Compass</li>
</ul>
<p>While it serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society, a wayfinder is as much a handy tool as a status symbol. A non-Pathfinder carrying one of these is likely to face complications if it is noticed by actual Pathfinders.</p>
<p><strong>Illuminate</strong>: <strong>Using a command word I can activate my Wayfinder to illuminate my zone and all adjacent zones unless obstructed, attaching the situational Aspect Illuminating Wayfinder</strong> to myself; I may actively defend against attempts to overcome this Aspect with narrative support.</p>
<p><strong>True North</strong>: Using my Wayfinder as a compass I am able to determine true north unless near a magnet or other disruptive force; I gain +1 while Carefully Focused to overcome being lost.</p>
<p><strong>Find A Way</strong>: Once per session I may gain +1 while I am being Careful or Clever and attempting an action; I may decide to use this ability after I have already rolled a relevant 4dF roll and determined the total number of shifts.</p>

<p><strong>Whispering Coin</strong>: Because I have a magical Whispering Coin, its special magical abilities aid me in my adventures.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="whispering-coin">Whispering Coin</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Thassilonian Relic</li>
<li>Strongly Magical (Divination)</li>
</ul>
<p>This ancient gold coin measures an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch thick. One face bears one of the seven ancient runes representing magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column.</p>
<p>When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in an ancient language, but which are never loud enough to understand.</p>
<p>Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either 'yes' (the rune) or 'no' (the broken column); the word 'yes' or 'no' is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture.</p>
<p>You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not 'Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?' The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not. If the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a 'yes' or 'no' into the user's ear. The coin's one use for the day is still consumed.</p>

<h1 id="sample-spells">Sample Spells</h1>
<p>The <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a> used by Pathfinder FAE allow &quot;free- casting&quot; by default, wherein spellcasters just use the four actions of Fate Accelerated to attack, defend, overcome, and create advantage with some extended options for create advantage. Thus, such characters do not need pregenerated &quot;spell&quot; write- ups.</p>
<p>But some players and GM's are not comfortable with making things up on the fly and might prefer having some write-ups to use instead, and others might benefit from some examples to get a sense of what is possible and therefore some sample spells are linked to below. However it is important to note that the material is not intended to be taken as comprehensive &quot;spell lists&quot;. The write-ups are just effects that have been used in play or written up to translate some source material into Pathfinder Fate Accelerated terms and are provided only as examples of things that can be done and <em>not</em> as definitive &quot;rules&quot; or assertions of how things <em>must</em> be done.</p>
<div class="Tip">
<p>Characters using the <a href="#prepared-casting-1">prepared casting</a> option have a set list of known spell write-ups vs free-casting and therefore might find the examples particularly relevant and helpful.</p>

I can affect additional mooks in the same zone as well, but the difficulty increases by +2 per extra mook I want to affect. The GM may rule that some mooks are not affected by this spell; for instance things that are not 'alive' or that do not need to sleep would generally be immune.

<h6 id="speak-with-dead">Speak With Dead</h6>
<p>Divine Spell (Necromantic)</p>
<p>Overcome while Carefully Divine vs a Fair (+2) difficulty to get the answer to one or more (1+) basic questions from a corpse; success grants one (1) question and each extra shift grants one (1) additional question. Some stipulations and restrictions apply.</p>
</div>
<p>You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to it. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the corpse was inimical to you in life, the answers may be grudging or incomplete but not untrue.</p>
<p>If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.</p>
<p>This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.</p>
<p>This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.</p>

Mystical senses or spells that detect magic or enhance perception might be able to penetrate my magic; overcoming a Fantastic (+6) difficulty allows a such an observer notice a faint but indeterminant magical aura around me, and overcoming an Astonishing (+9) difficulty reveals my true form.

<h1 id="sample-stunts">Sample Stunts</h1>
<h2 id="abyssal-stunts">Abyssal Stunts</h2>
<p>Stunts strongly related to beings of the Abyss or those descended from them, such as fiendish demons and tieflings.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Abyssal Darkness</strong>: Because I have fiendish lineage, once per session as an action I have the ability to add the situational Aspect <strong>Abyssal Darkness</strong> to my zone or an adjacent zone. When I activate this ability I can choose to spread it to cover additional contiguous zones at the cost of one (1) Fate point per additional zone. This effect provides active Superb (+5) defense against notice attempts and targeted abilites. This Aspect lasts for an entire scene, though it can be overcome and removed by a character with Arcane, Divine, or Primal of +3 or higher opposed by a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I am unaffected by this Aspect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Abyssal Lineage</strong>: Because I am born of a bloodline with abyssal lineage, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Arcane and casting spells related to fire, darkness, and demonology.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Blade Of Abyssal Flame (-3)</strong>: Because of my demonic nature I can conjure a flaming magical longsword at will; I gain +1 to attack and defend and can use Focused in place of Combatives while wielding it. If I get a boost while attacking or defending with it, I may upgrade the boost to apply the Aspect <strong>Abyssal Flame!</strong> with two (2) invokes on it to the opponent I am engaged with.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Born Of Flame and Darkness</strong>: Because I have fiendish lineage, when I am Flashily Focused I am able to project searing flames from my body as an attack at targets within my zone or in an adjacent zone; these attacks are considered to be Arcane. Additionally I can justify create advantage, overcome, and defend actions when fire, heat, darkness, or demons are involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Demonic Durability</strong>: Because my demonic nature makes me much more durable than normal, I reduce by two (2) all stress inflicted on me by physical attacks. However this does not work against magic, cold iron, or weapons blessed by a benign deity.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Demonic Immunity (-3)</strong>: Because of my demonic nature, I am immune to electricity, fire, disease, and poison. However, positive energy inflicts 2 extra shifts of stress against me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fiendish Bane</strong>: Because of my fiendish nature, I inflict two (2) extra shifts of damage when I physically attack devout followers of benign deities.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fiendish Bolt</strong>: Because I have learned to channel my fiendish lineage into my magic, I gain +1 to attack while Flashily Arcane by projecting an ominously glowing arc of energy at an opponent within four (4) zones of me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fiendish Teleportation</strong>: Because I inherited the ability to teleport (though not effortlessly), once per session as an action I can remove myself from the scene by teleporting myself elsewhere. My range is limited to somewhere within approximately fifty (50) miles of my current location.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fiendish Teleportation (-2)</strong>: Because of my fiendish nature I am able to teleport myself. Once per scene as an action I can remove myself from the scene by teleporting elsewhere. My range is limited to somewhere within approximately five hundred (500) miles of my current location.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mantle Of Abyssal Power (-2)</strong>: Because I am invested with Abyssal power that cloaks and protects me, I gain +1 when Sneaky to create advantage or overcome to avoid notice, and I may use Focused to defend against magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Profane Gift</strong>: <strong>Because of my demonic nature, once per day I can attach the Aspect Profane Gift</strong> with two (2) invokes to a single person I am in intimate contact with. While this Aspect is active the recipient may invoke it for a +2 bonus to any action they are attempting. Further, I can make telepathic contact with the recipient and if they are dominated by me I can issue commands via this contact. The Aspect lasts one day, can be detected by those with special senses as a Superb (+5) challenge, and can be removed by those with applicable Arcane abjuration or Divine abilities by overcoming a Superb (+5) challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Summon Babau (-3)</strong>: Because of my fiendish nature, once per session as an action I can summon a babau demon and command it to serve me for a scene.</p>
<div class="description">
<h6 id="babau-demon-1">Babau Demon</h6>
<p><strong>Aspects</strong> - Murderously Lethal - Outsider</p>
<p><strong>Good At</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cruel Murder (+6)</li>
<li>Jumping (+3)</li>
<li>Stealth (+3)</li>

<ul>
<li>[1][2][3]</li>
<li>Mild (2)</li>
<li>Moderate (4)</li>
<li>Severe (6)</li>
</ul>
<p>The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist---certainly not traits unusual in the demons, yet the babau's penchant for stealth and surprise sets it apart from its generally less-subtle kin. With no need to eat (although most babaus relish the flavor of mortal meat on their thin, raspy tongues), a babau can wait in ambush for years or decades---their inhuman patience in anticipating a well-conceived murder also setting them apart from the other denizens of the Abyss.</p>
<p>Babaus obsess over the act of killing and take great pride in their grisly art, often leaving behind some form of grim marker or obscure signature, whether it be a distinctive modus operandi, an unnerving token, or other profane evidence.</p>
<p>A babau typically carries a longspear or other weapon with which it can strike at foes beyond its normal reach, but given the opportunity, a babau prefers to fight with its teeth or claws. The foul, caustic sludge that constantly seeps from their flesh prevents them from wearing armor unless it is specially treated or resistant to acid.</p>
<p>A babau is 6 feet tall but weighs only 140 pounds. They form from mortal souls of lone killers---those who, in life, took pleasure in more personal and intimate murders. Loosed upon the Material Plane, a babau often finds itself in the same role, haunting the shadowy corners of the world as remorseless assassins.</p>

<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +3 to attack a target within two (2) zones of me by throwing an alchemical acid bomb at them.</p>
<p>If I am successful, the acid bomb shatters, splashing its contents upon my target and inflicting damage as stress normally, but if I succeed with style, I must reduce the stress to get a boost and the boost is upgraded to the situational Aspect <strong>Acid Burn!</strong> which is attached to the target.</p>
<p>This Aspect is automatically invoked at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress to the target per invoke. This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of acid bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my acid bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>

I must choose the items I have on me at the start of a session or when appropriate to the narrative; I can choose any combination from the list adding up to my per-session limit.

<p>When I am Cleverly Focused I gain +1 to throw a bomb into my zone or an adjacent zone, generally against an Average (+1) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful, my bomb explodes and inflicts a number of shifts of damage equal to my (Careful + Arcane) against every target in the zone without splitting shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of alchemical bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can not catalyze my bombs, they are only usable by me.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>

<p>If I am successful the gas bomb shatters, releasing toxic fumes and applying the situational Aspect <strong>Toxic Gas!</strong> to the zone with two free invokes.</p>
<p>This Aspect is automatically invoked now and at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress per invoke to every target within the affected zone that needs to breathe. This Aspect can be removed by strong winds or focused air by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of gas bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my gas bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Gas Mask</strong>: Because I have a gas mask, while I am wearing it I am immune to gas-based effects including but not limited to poison gas or other effects that target the respiratory system including but not limited to dusts and pheremones. Additionally, improved optics in the mask's goggles grant me a +1 bonus when I am attempting to use my vision to create advantage or overcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Holy Water Vials</strong>: Because I have learned a special alchemical recipe, I am able to make a mildly magical mixture containing holy water, garlic, powdered silver, and grave dust that causes harm to the undead. These vials can be thrown, with the liquid splashing out upon impact to inflict harm on an undead creature.</p>
<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +4 to attack an undead target within one (1) zone of me.</p>
<p>If I am successful, the holy water vial shatters, splashing its contents upon my target and inflicting damage as stress normally, but this damage <em>cannot be reduced</em> by any innate ability of the target (other forms of protection such as a magic item or a spell do apply).</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of holy water vials equal to my <strong>(Clever + Arcane)</strong>. Other people can use my holy water vials; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>

<p>This Aspect is automatically invoked now and at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress per invoke to every target that needs to breathe within the affected zones. This Aspect can be removed by strong winds or focused air by overcoming a Good (+3) difficulty.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of gas bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my gas bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>

<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use. :::</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mutagen (Beastshape; -2)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity, taking on the forms of animals. I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form.</p>
<p>When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). This lasts for an entire scene unless I choose to return to normal, which ends the effect. Additionally, I may spend another Fate point to assume a different animal's form, and I do not have to first change back to normal.</p>
<p>When I change forms I gain an additional Aspect named for the animal form I have assumed which I can invoke when my current animal form is relevant, and which can be compelled whenever my animal form or lack of humanoid anatomy might inconvenience me.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has natural weapons I may use Focused in place of Combatives while in a physical conflict.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Mutagen (Bruteform)</strong>: Because I have mastered strange transmogrifying magics I can concoct substances that allow me to change my own physical structure and capacity, becoming much larger and stronger but at the cost of greatly diminished intellgence. I may spend a Fate point to temporarily move all of my Approach bonuses to Forceful (leaving all of my other Approaches at +0), and to move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). I also change my Trouble to <strong>'Mutagenic Brute'</strong>. This lasts for an entire scene unless I spend another Fate point to change back to normal.</p>

<p><strong>Potions, Poultices, Poisons</strong>: Because I know ancient lores from more primitive times, I am able to brew potions, poultices, and poisons that can harm and heal and work odd and subtle magics on those who imbide them. I can be Cleverly Arcane and make substances that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal.

<p>If a strict economy is being enforced in the campaign, it usually costs about half retail price to make a concoction; GM's discretion applies.</p>
<p>To prepare a concoction I roll 4dF and add (Focused + Arcane) against a Mediocre (+0) difficulty; failure indicates a botched concoction and that 'slot' is wasted for the day. I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the concoction I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Prepared concoctions are activated by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the effect of the concoction using the previously rolled margin of success.

<p><strong>Restorative Elixir</strong>: Because of my alchemical studies I am able to create and then later use restorative elixirs.</p>
<p>When I am Carefully Focused I gain +3 to overcome vs a Superb (+5) difficulty.</p>
<p>If I am successful I remove all debilitating situational Aspects currently affecting my health or normal functioning that have a difficulty to remove of Great (+4) or less. This does not work on environmental Aspects, scene Aspects, or other situational Aspects that affect me externally, it only works against situational Aspects that affect me directly and personally such as poison, fatigue, some spells, curses, and so forth.</p>
<p>Additionally, if I am successful, I may also clear one of my stress boxes or a Mild Consequence.</p>
<p>To use this ability I must be able to access the elixir and drink its contents.</p>
<p>For a given session I can make and carry around a number of Restorative Elixirs equal to my (Clever + Arcane).

<p>When I am Quickly Focused I gain +3 to create advantage against a target within two (2) zones of me by throwing a sticky bomb at them.</p>
<p>If I am successful, the sticky bomb shatters, splashing its sticky contents upon my target, attaching the situational Aspect <strong>Trapped By Sticky Goo!</strong> to the target with three (3) invokes. While this Aspect is in play, the target is rooted in their current zone and thus cannot move to another zone. This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+4) difficulty, but each failed attempt to overcome it expends an invoke.</p>
<p>This Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Good (+4) difficulty. However when it is expended or removed a second situational Aspect, <strong>Sticky Goo Residue!</strong>, is attached to the target with four (4) invokes. The second Aspect prevents the target from moving more than one (1) zone per action, and they cannot both move and attack. The second Aspect can be removed by overcoming a Superb (+6) difficulty, but each failed attempt to overcome it expends an invoke.</p>
<p>Note that this ability can cause flying targets to plummet to the ground if they use winged flight.</p>
<p>For a given session I can carry around and use a number of sticky bombs equal to my (Clever + Arcane). Other people can use my sticky bombs; they still count against my per-session limit however.</p>

While I am Carefully Arcane and I have access to my alchemical supplies, I may clear a Stress box or clear a Consequence by overcoming a difficulty equal to the numerical value of the stress box or Consequence.

Each trapbusting kit contains enough raw materials to mix up an acid or a neutralizing agent or even a small shaped explosive sufficient to counter one trap.</p>
<p>Using trapbusting kits that I made myself, I gain +5 while Carefully Roguish to overcome mechanical or magical traps that have a triggering mechanism.</p>
<p>To use this ability I must be able to access the materials in the trapbusting kit to mix up a compound to suit the situation and be able to apply it directly to the triggering mechanism of the trap.</p>
<p>For a given session I can make and carry around a number of trapbusting kits equal to my (Clever + Arcane + Roguish).

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Aegis</strong>: Because I have mastered protecting myself with magic, I may use Arcane to defend against physical attacks without needing to first create an advantage to invoke.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Arcane Archery</strong>: Because I am an Arcane Archer, when I am Cleverly Arcane and use a bow and arrow I get +2 when I attack and the attack is considered to be magic rather than mundane.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Bolts</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of Arcane Bolts, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Arcane and attack with ranged magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Domination (-2)</strong>: Because of my mastery of mind-affecting enchantments, while I am Forcefully Arcane I can make mental attacks against a living target in my zone or an adjacent zone. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against the target's nature. If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Arcane Senses</strong>: Because I have developed my arcane senses to impressive heights, I may use Arcane instead of Focused to notice or perceive things and I can sense things that require mystical awareness to detect.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Bestow Curse</strong>: Because I am skilled at afflicting others with curses, I get +2 while Arcanely creating advantage by using my magic to put a situational Aspect representing a curse or other temporary magical impediment on a living sentient person or creature. The difficulty to overcome one of my curses with appropriate magic is equal to my (Arcane + Primal) bonuses; the target can also overcome the curse themselves while Carefully Focused but the difficulty is +1 higher. There is no zone restriction on this ability, but I must be able to see my target, and I cannot move zones in the same exchange that I use this ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Chained Lightning</strong>: Because I am able to project a bolt of lighting that jumps from target to target, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all enemy targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Charmingly Arcane</strong>: Because I practice using my magic to charm the unwitting, I'm very good at it. While I am Sneakily Arcane I can make social attacks against a living target in my same zone. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against the target's nature. If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences.</p>

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Beauty</strong>: Because I am adept at using subtle enchantments to magically enhance my beauty, I may add my Arcane capability as a bonus to any social interaction where my appearance can be a factor; however this can be resisted by Arcane and is a Mind-Affecting effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Enchanting Empathy</strong>: Because I am a master of enchantment magics that allow me to manipulate the emotional states of others, while I am Cleverly Arcane I can engage a target in a social conflict and if I inflict a Consequence I can afflict them with a propensity for a specific emotion. Consequences such as <strong>Fits Of Uncontrollable Rage</strong>, <strong>Plunged Into Deep Sadness</strong>, <strong>Gripped By Passionate Love</strong>, and <strong>Overwhelmed By Euphoric Happiness</strong> incite those afflicted to act out in ways appropriate to the emotional state I have imposed on them. If, while I share a scene with the target, a Consequences I have inflicted with this ability is compelled and the target spends a fate point to refuse the compel, I gain the fate point immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Evil Eye</strong>: Because I can hex others with the power of the Evil Eye, I gain +2 while Arcanely creating advantage to attach the spell Aspect <strong>The Eye Is Upon You</strong> to a person or creature in my zone that I can see. This spell Aspect lasts until it has no more invokes remaining or it is overcome. Anyone in the scene may invoke this Aspect to penalize or interfere with the target's actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Familiar (Bonded)</strong>: Because I have a mystical familiar I am always accompanied by an animal that is particularly smart and capable for its kind.

<p><strong>Fireburst</strong>: Because I am able to cause a mystical explosion to occur, once per session when I am Flashily Arcane and attack I may affect all targets in up to two contiguous adjacent zones without having to split my shifts between them. This is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Forced Dementia</strong>: Because I have the ability to afflict the minds of others with mental confusion and temporary insanity, I gain +1 while Arcane to create advantage on a foe within my zone to place the situational Aspect <strong>Demented Confusion</strong> upon them.

The Aspect lasts for a scene but can be overcome via appropriate magic as a Superb (+5) difficulty challenge.

<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Hedge Arcanist</strong>: Because I practice a more ancient form of Arcane magic that remains connected to the natural world, while Arcane I can cast spells that replicate effects that are usually the province of Primal. Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use.</p>

Additionally, I can identify mundane poisons, provide simple remedies for headaches and minor mundane illnesses, embellish prepared food, and other such things when my herbal lore is relevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Levitation</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of mystic levitation, while I am Flashily Arcane I may attempt to overcome a Superb (+5) difficulty to create the situational Aspect <strong>Levitating</strong> on myself. While this Aspect is in play I may levitate; while levitating I am unaffected by obstacles that I can levitate over, and I can hover out of easy reach of the ground thus frustrating melee attackers. This Aspect can be overcome by appropriate magic, with a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I cannot invoke the Aspect for any additional benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mage Armor Knack</strong>: Because I have a minor magical knack, I can create advantage while Carefully Arcane vs an Average (+1) difficulty to apply the Aspect <strong>Mage Armor</strong> to myself. While this Aspect is active I gain +2 when defending against physical or damaging magical attacks. This Aspect may also be invoked to offer additional protection when defending from physical or magical harm. This Aspect can be overcome and removed as a Superb (+5) difficulty by those with Arcane +3 or higher.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mana Bolts</strong>: Because I am able to launch target-seeking magical bolts, when I am Cleverly Arcane and attack I may spend a Fate point or suffer the Mild Consequence <strong>Spell Fatigue</strong> to affect all enemy targets in an adjacent zone without having to split my shifts between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Necromantic Enervation</strong>: Because I am a master of necromancy, I am able to drain the life energy from others. While I am Sneakily Arcane I can attack others with 'Life Draining' spells; in addition to the stress if I inflict a Consequence on my target I afflict them with enervation and ennui. Consequences such as <strong>Easily Fatigued</strong>, <strong>Fits Of Ennui</strong>, <strong>Prone To Depression</strong>, and <strong>Sunk Into A Deep Funk</strong> cause those afflicted to struggle to motivate and empower themselves, to unexpectedly lose interest in being active, become unconcerned about succeeding in their endeavors, and so forth. If a target is taken out in this way, they die and rise again as an Undead minion that I can control for the remainder of the scene and possibly longer at the GM's discretion.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Prepared Caster (Arcane)</strong>: Because of my studies as a classically trained arcanist, each morning I may 'prepare' a number of 'spells' equal to ((Careful + Clever) * Arcane).</p>
<p>To prepare a spell I roll 4dF against a Mediocre (+0) difficulty, adding a preparation bonus equal to double my Arcane bonus.</p>
<p>I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the spell I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Later during the day I may 'cast' a prepared spell by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the spell using the previously rolled margin of success.</p>
<p>It is possible for a spell resolution to fail if the margin of success is insufficient to the difficulty or if I am opposed successfully. I can spend a Fate point at this time to add +2 shifts to the margin of success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to my focus on prepared casting, I cannot free cast anything other than simple arcane spells known as cantrips.</p>
<p><em>Using Spell Write-ups</em></p>
<p>If I am preparing a spell from a write-up that indicates an Approach be combined with Arcane to cast the spell, with language such as 'while Cleverly Arcane', I ignore the requirement and use my prepared bonus instead.</p>
<p>If I am preparing a spell from a write-up that states a particular difficulty level, with language such as 'vs a Good (+3) difficulty)', the previously rolled margin of success is applied against the stated difficulty when I 'cast' it; any remaining shifts can be allocated per the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a>.</p>

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Scroll Scrivener</strong>: Because I have mastered the art of scribing scrolls, I can be Cleverly Arcane and prepare 'spell completion' items as scrolls or similar items for specific spell effects that I can cast. I can later cast the inscribed spell (using the simple magic system guidelines) from the item, gaining a bonus in the process. Other characters with Arcane +1 or better can also use my scrolls. I can also stockpile unused scrolls, as well as use scrolls inscribed by others. Unless explicitly denied means and opportunity, I can prepare a number of new scrolls ready for use equal to my Arcane capability each day.</p>

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Mastery (Prismatic Spray)</strong>:</p>
<p>Because I have mastered the <a href="#prismatic-spray-1">Prismatic Spray</a> spell, I've gotten really good at catching as many people as possible inside of the arc. When I cast 'Prismatic Spray' and split shifts between multiple targets within my zone or an adjacent zone, the targets each suffer a -1 penalty to defend against my attack.</p>
<p>Additionally, if any target takes a consequence from this attack I can force it to be called <strong>Dazzled By Prismacolor!</strong> and I get an extra free invoke on it.</p>

<p><strong>Spell Turning</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per scene if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Spell Turning (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per exchange if I am the target of an Arcane spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Cleverly Arcane; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Witch's Fire</strong>: Because I can sicken others with magical energies, while Flashily Arcane I suffer a -1 penalty to attack one or more targets in my zone with a blast of eerie mystical energies, but if I split shifts between multiple targets the targets each suffer a -1 penalty to defend against my attack. If I succeed with style against any of the targets in all cases I must reduce the stress to get a boost, but the boost is automatically upgraded to the situational Aspect <strong>Sickened</strong> with two (2) invokes, which is attached to the affected target. This Aspect is automatically invoked at the beginning of subsequent exchanges to inflict two (2) stress to the target per invoke as the magical attack continues to linger; the target cannot defend against this additional stress but may apply any resistances or protection they have such as damage reduction or immunity to magic.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Double Shot</strong>: Because I am skilled at rapidly shooting twice as fast as normal, I gain +1 when I am Quick and attack with any kind of bow or a reapeating crossbow or two crossbows against a target within my zone or an adjacent zone and if I hit I may make a second identical attack against the same target using the rolled result of the first attack rather than rolling to attack again. The target gets to defend against the second attack as normal.</p>

<h2 id="bloodline-stunts">Bloodline Stunts</h2>
<p>Stunts related to having an unusual bloodline that grants special abilities. Typically associated with [sorcerers] in the source material, but freely usable in Pathfinder Fate Accelerated whereever they might be appropriate to fill out a character concept.</p>
<p>Bloodlines bundle a bunch of abilities together. Ideally a character just takes the entire bundle as is, but cherry-picking is permitted.</p>
<p>Many bloodlines have an Approach and / or Archetype bonus requirement. To take the bloodline a character must have at least the required level of bonus. For instance, the Abyssal Bloodline requires a character to have at least Flashy +1 and Focused +1 to take it.</p>
<div class="description">

<p>This bloodline requires Flashy +1 and Focused +1 or better to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Weapons</strong>: Because I have natural weapons and am skilled in their use, I may use Focused instead of Combative when my natural weapons are relevant. In situations where it matters I can choose to be treated as attacking barehanded or attacking with a weapon, whichever benefits me more in the situation. Finally, though I can be inconvenienced and my natural weapons can be fouled or restrained, being disarmed is generally off the table for me.</li>
<li><strong>Demonic Durability</strong>: Because my demonic nature makes me much more durable than normal, I reduce by two (2) all stress inflicted on me by physical attacks. However this does not work against magic, cold iron, or weapons blessed by a benign deity.</li>
<li><strong>Fiendish Teleportation</strong>: Because I inherited the ability to teleport (though not effortlessly), once per session as an action I can remove myself from the scene by teleporting myself elsewhere. My range is limited to somewhere within approximately fifty (50) miles of my current location.</li>
<li><strong>Mantle Of Abyssal Power (-2)</strong>: Because I am invested with Abyssal power that cloaks and protects me, I gain +1 when Sneaky to create advantage or overcome to avoid notice, and I may use Focused to defend against magic.</li>
</ul>

Further, I may also add my Primal capability modifier as a bonus to my roll when I do so.</li>
<li><strong>Evil Eye</strong>: Because I can hex others with the power of the Evil Eye, I gain +2 while Arcanely creating advantage to attach the spell Aspect <strong>The Eye Is Upon You</strong> to a person or creature in my zone that I can see.

<li><strong>Forbidding Presence</strong>: Because I present a very intimidating and stern visage while emanating a frightenting aura, I gain +1 when being Flashy and attempting to frighten or demoralize.</li>
<li><strong>Forced Dementia</strong>: Because I have the ability to afflict the minds of others with mental confusion and temporary insanity, I gain +1 while Arcane to create advantage on a foe within my zone to place the situational Aspect <strong>Demented Confusion</strong> upon them.

The Aspect lasts for a scene but can be overcome via appropriate magic as a Superb (+5) difficulty challenge. The recipient themselves can also overcome the Aspect while Carefully Focused as a Fantastic (+6) difficulty challenge. This is a mind-affecting ability.</li>

<ul>

<p>This bloodline requires Sneaky +1 and Focused +1 or better to use.</p>
<p><strong>Better Lucky Than Good</strong>: Because I am unusually lucky, whenever I make a 4dF resolution roll and the result is [0 0 0 0] (all blanks) I treat the outcome as if I had rolled [+ + + +] (all pluses).]</p>
<p><strong>Secret Signs</strong>: Because I have an unusual mystical talent I sometimes see signs, portents, and sigils that provide me with information about the present or near future that I could not possibly know otherwise. I gain +2 while I am Focused and create advantage when I attempt to discover or notice some detail, fact, Aspect, or truth about the scene, or a person or group in it, even if it would not normally be possible for me to know or detect this information with merely mundane senses.</p>
<p><strong>Close Call</strong>: Because I excel at getting out of really bad situations, I can spend a fate point to concede after I already rolled to defend (normally a concession must be made instead of rolling to defend).</p>
<p><strong>Sublime Expertise (-2)</strong>: Because I am extremely skilled and rarely blunder, whenever I make a 4dF roll I treat any result of less than 0 as -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Draconic Bloodline (-5)</strong></p>
<p>This bloodline requires Forceful +1 and Focused +1 or better to use.</p>

<li><strong>Supernatural Durability</strong>: Because I am descended from one or more supernatural ancestors I am more durable than normal. I reduce by one (1) all non-magical stress inflicted on me.</li>
<li><strong>Spell-like Abilities</strong>: Because my lineage grants me innate magical capabilities, I may use my Focused Archetype instead of the Arcane Archetype to activate a small set of specific magical abilities and to intuitively understand magical phenomenon related to my particular lineage. GM's discretion applies.</li>
<li><strong>Breath Weapon (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to expel a specific kind of breath attack from my mouth, once per scene I may make a special attack affecting all targets (animate and inanimate) in my zone without having to split my shifts between them. In addition to inflicting stress, I can also re-use the results of my attack roll to attempt to overcome or alter a single situtational aspect present in the affected zone if I can narratively justify it; for instance I could overcome an obstruction by destroying it. This attack is non-discriminatory and often causes collateral damage at the GM's discretion, such as modifying ambient descriptors within the affected zone to reflect a damaged or ruined state; for instance a <strong>Fancy Hotel Room</strong> descriptor aspect might be altered to instead be <strong>Scorched Hotel Room</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

This Aspect can be overcome by appropriate magic, with a Legendary (+8) difficulty. I cannot invoke the Aspect for any additional benefit.</li>

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Air Of Command</strong>: Because I have an imperious air of command and aura of authority, I gain +2 to create advantage or overcome during social encounters when giving orders to sentient NPCs that lack consequences.

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Armed Intimidation</strong>: Because I am well armed and visibly dangerous, I may add my Combative capability to create advantage or overcome when I attempt to intimidate or assert control over a social situation if I am armed appropriately.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Commanding Voice</strong>: Because I am able to speak in a commanding voice that compels obedience in those of lesser willpower; I may use Focused for social interactions if I can talk, and I am resisted by Focused when I do so. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

Allies must be within three (3) zones and within line of sight of me to benefit from my leadership. This ability applies for the duration of the conflict even if I am taken out, as my allies are moved to protect or avenge me.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rally Leader</strong>: Because I am able to inspire my allies to regroup and rally, once per scene I can give a motivating monologue or shout out words of courage and valor to allow all allies within one (1) zone of me to clear one of their stress boxes or a Mild consequence.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Duelist</strong>: Because I am skilled at the art of using weapons such as thinblades, foils, rapiers, epees, sabres, and stilettos (i.e, 'dueling' weapons), I am a surprisingly effective combatant when armed appropriately. Though my fighting style remains agile and even acrobatic at times, when armed with an appropriate weapon I can use Focused in place of Combatives in armed physical conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Dungeoneer</strong>: Because I am a seasoned adventurer and dungeoneer, I gain +2 when I am Clever and create advantage or overcome when a item of common adventurer gear that I have proves to be useful.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Jack-of-all-Trades (-3)</strong>: Because I am a jack of all trades who has studied an array of different crafts, during a scene I may spend a fate point as a free action to allow myself to use Focused as if it were any one other Archetype for the remainder of the scene.

<p><strong>Morale Boosting Performance</strong>: Because I am a naturally gifted performer, I gain +2 when I am Flashily Focused and create subtle advantages affecting morale or mental states, or help others overcome challeges by motivating them, when I am able to make music. I can also make long journeys less boring when stealth is not required, and make some spare coin performing at taverns and such.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Nothing Succeeds Like Success (-3)</strong>: Because nothing succeeds like success, when I succeed with style and gain a boost I may upgrade that boost to a situational Aspect on myself called <strong>On A Roll!</strong> with two (2) invokes on it. If the Aspect is already active, I instead add two (2) more free invokes to it. The Aspect is removed at the end of the scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>One Against Many</strong>: Because I am skilled at defending myself against multiple attackers, I gain +2 to defend when I fight alone against two or more opponents. A single mook defined as a mob counts as being multiple opponents for purposes of this ability as long as there are two or more 'individuals' within the mob. 'Fighting alone' in this context means no allies are in my zone or an adjacent zone, and no ally is aiding me or attacking my opponents.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Raw Charisma</strong>: Because I am naturally likeable and charismatic, I may use Focused instead of Roguish for social interactions related to making friends and influencing people. I gain +1 while Focused to create advantage or overcome challenges when using this Stunt. However some people innately distrust charming people, and I sometimes meet unexpected friction to my overtures. When using this Stunt I can be compelled by the GM to fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Riposte</strong>: Because even my defense is dangerous, whenever I am Flashily Focused and defend with style against a physical melee attack while wielding a dueling weapon I may use the boost to inflict a single point of stress on my attacker, immediately, as a free action.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rogue's Reflexes</strong>: Because I have great reflexes and am able to evade harm better than most people, I may use Roguish to defend against any kind of indirect or surprise attack and to avoid harm by getting out of the way of it. Narratively this can take many forms, such as rolling out of the way, ducking behind cover, 'seeing it coming' and somehow interupting the attack, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Roguish +2 to use.</p>
<p>NOTE: Roguish +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Roguish +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Rural Warrior</strong>: Because I am skilled at using practical, functional weapons such as hunting spears and bows, woodsman axes, cudgels, lariats, and weapons derived from farming equipment I am a surprisingly effective combatant when armed appropriately. Though my fighting style is no-frills and straightforward, when armed with an appropriate weapon I can use Focused in place of Combatives in armed physical conflicts and I gain +1 to create advantage attempts that utilize my unusual weaponry in interesting ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sublime Expertise (-2)</strong>: Because I am extremely skilled and rarely blunder, whenever I make a 4dF roll I treat any result of less than 0 as -1.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Trapsetter</strong>: Because I am skilled at setting traps, as a non-action I can spend a Fate point to create the situational Aspect <strong>Trapped!</strong> on my zone or up to three (3) zones away with two (2) invokes. The Aspect represents a trap I happened to have set up while no one was looking, or a clever exploitation of the ambient scenery. My traps can take many forms, limited only to things I can narratively justify. I can invoke the Aspect to hinder someone in the affected zone or to help myself or an ally acting against someone in the affected zone. The difficulty for others to notice my trap before the first time it is invoked or to overcome it is equal to my (Clever + Sneaky + Primal) traits if in a wildlands area, otherwise it is equal to my (Clever + Sneaky + Roguish) traits.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Tumbler</strong>: Because I am excellent at acrobatically flipping around and tumbling, if I am in a conflict and do nothing in an exchange except move, I may move an additional zone and I am unobstructed by minor obstacles that I can tumble around or flip over. If I am in a contest involving me running away from something or avoiding capture, I gain +1 to overcome while I am Quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Staves Are Just So Useful</strong>: Because I have learned to put my staff to good use, I gain +1 when I am Careful and narratively describe how my staff helps me. This can be used to aid me in my spell casting as well as to fend off pesky attackers, or whatever fits the story.</p>

<h2 id="hindrance-stunts">Hindrance Stunts</h2>
<p>Flaws, drawbacks, complications, and so on.</p>
<p>Unlike normal Stunts which deplete a character's Refresh, characters gain one or more Refresh from a Hindrance...but only for offsetting the Refresh equivalence of other Stunts.</p>
<p>For example, a character with three Stunts and a Hindrance gains no mechanical benefit as characters normally start with three free Stunt slots. However a character with four Stunts and a Hindrance that is worth +1 Refresh equivalence would not have to reduce their Refresh for the fourth Stunt as the Hindrance has offset its impact.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Breath Weapon (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to expel a specific kind of breath attack from my mouth, once per scene I may make a special attack affecting all targets (animate and inanimate) in my zone without having to split my shifts between them. In addition to inflicting stress, I can also re-use the results of my attack roll to attempt to overcome or alter a single situtational aspect present in the affected zone if I can narratively justify it; for instance I could overcome an obstruction by destroying it. This attack is non-discriminatory and often causes collateral damage at the GM's discretion, such as modifying ambient descriptors within the affected zone to reflect a damaged or ruined state; for instance a <strong>Fancy Hotel Room</strong> descriptor aspect might be altered to instead be <strong>Scorched Hotel Room</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Halfling Fortune</strong>: Because I am attuned to my Halfling nature, once per session when attempting an action I can narratively justify and have even a small chance of succeeding at, I may spend a Fate point to automatically succeed rather than attempt a 4dF resolution.

Each exchange I continue my seduction I may make mental attacks against the target. Consequences inflicted by this ability pertain to my gaining increasing control over the target's mind. If the target concedes to me, the target must do as I command in general but retains enough control to avoid doing anything fundamentally against their nature (i.e. they may resist one of my commands if they have a relevant Aspect). If the target is taken out with this ability I assume full control of the target's behavior until they are able to recover from the Consequences. This is a mind-affecting ability.</p>

<p>I temporarily gain a new personal Aspect corresponding to the rite I prepared with <strong>one invoke, and annotated with the margin of success</strong>.</p>
<p>Later during the day I may 'cast' a prepared rite by invoking its Aspect as an action and resolving the rite using the previously rolled margin of success.</p>
<p>It is possible for a rite resolution to fail if the margin of success is insufficient to the difficulty or if I am opposed successfully. I can spend a Fate point at this time to add +2 shifts to the margin of success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to my focus on prepared casting, I cannot free cast anything other than simple primal effects known as favors.</p>
<p><em>Using Spell Write-ups</em></p>
<p>If I am preparing a rite from a write-up that indicates an Approach be combined with Primal to cast the rite, with language such as 'while Sneakily Primal', I ignore the requirement and use my prepared bonus instead.</p>
<p>If I am preparing a rite from a write-up that states a particular difficulty level, with language such as 'vs a Good (+3) difficulty)', the previously rolled margin of success is applied against the stated difficulty when I 'cast' it; any remaining shifts can be allocated per the <a href="#simple-magic-guidelines">Simple Magic Guidelines</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Valimancer / Theurge</strong>: Because I have mastered the ancient magics of the Primal Element of Positive Energy, the raw quintessence from which all material things are formed, I may combine my Divine and Primal Archetypes when I am casting spells related to radiance (pure energy), healing, creation ex nihilo, directly opposing negative energy, and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>Sense Deceit</strong>: Because I am so skilled at sensing people's true motives, I gain +2 when I am Cleverly Roguish and attempt to discern if I am being deceived or tricked.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Verbal Skirmisher</strong>: Because I am adept at applying my understanding of tactics and strategy to the 'social battlefield', I may use Combative instead of Roguish for social interactions such as debating, arguing, insulting, taunting, and assertively taking control of a social scene. I gain +1 while Combative to create advantage or overcome challenges when using this Stunt. However people tend to take offense; things sometimes escalate, and enemies are sometimes made.</p>
<p>When using this Stunt I can be compelled by the GM to fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wheeler Dealer</strong>: Because I excel at talking my way into and out of situations and making deals, I gain +2 while Cleverly Roguish in social situations.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="special-stunts">Special Stunts</h2>
<p>Stunts that are unusual, push the envelope, or otherwise resist easy categorization.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Better Lucky Than Good</strong>: [Because I am unusually lucky, whenever I make a 4dF resolution roll and the result is 0 0 0 0 (all blanks) I treat the outcome as if I had rolled + + + + (all pluses).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Charmed Existence</strong>: Because I lead a charmed existence, whenever I roll - - -- (all minuses) on 4dF I treat it as if I rolled 0 0 0 0 (all blanks).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Cloud Step</strong>: Because I have mastered a mystic discipline, I may defy the normal bonds of the earth to float upon the wind and available contact points as if I weighed no more than a feather. I am never harmed or unduly inconvenienced by falling, even if I am unconscious. However this effect is temporarily cancelled if I am encumbered or anchored by more than half my own body weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Companion's Senses</strong>: Because I share a mystical bond with my animal companion, I may spend a Fate point to share their senses for a scene at a range of a few dozen miles. This allows me to witness events through the senses of my companion as if I were present. This can be detected by others with appropriate senses as a Quick + Primal overcome action vs a Fantastic (+6) difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Control Aquatic Creatures</strong>: Because I can control aquatic creatures, I can justify using Primal to have social encounters with aquatic creatures as if I share a language with them, and under most circumstances they are generally friendly to me. I also gain +1 to create advantages related to gaining aid or cooperation from aquatic creatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Detect Evil</strong>: Because I am sensitive to ethical and moral propensities, I am able to sense strong concentrations of immorality and evilness in individuals, objects, and areas from six (6) zones away even if the source in not detectable to my other senses. Additionally, I gain +2 to notice relevant concentrations of evil while Focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Detect Good</strong>: Because I am sensitive to ethical and moral propensities, I am able to sense strong concentrations of virtue and goodness in individuals, objects, and areas from six (6) zones away even if the source in not detectable to my other senses. Additionally, I gain +2 to notice relevant concentrations of goodness while Focused.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Fated Fortune</strong>: Because I thrive under pressure, when I spend a fate point to invoke one of my Aspects I gain a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Favored By Fortune</strong>: Because I am unusually lucky, I add +1 shift to my total whenever I make a 4dF resolution roll and there are no minuses (-) in the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Firebreath (-3)</strong>: Because I am able to expel a cone of burning flame from my mouth, I gain +2 to make a special flaming breath attack affecting all targets in my zone without having to split my shifts between them. This attack is non-discriminatory, and often causes collateral damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Globe Of Invulnerability</strong>: Because I have mastered a potent magical discipline, when I am Carefully Arcane I can <strong>spend a Fate point</strong> to allow create an advantage to add the situational Aspect <strong>Globe Of Invulnerability</strong> with two (2) invokes to myself for the remainder of the scene (and perhaps longer). I can add more invokes to this Aspect by being Carefully Arcane and creating an advantage against a difficulty of Great (+4). While this Aspect is available I can invoke it to use Carefully Arcane to defend against any kind of attack affecting me or the area immediately around me (including any allies). This Aspect can be overcome and removed by a character with Arcane, Divine, or Primal of +4 or higher opposed by a Legendary (+8) difficulty.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +4 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Globe Of Invulnerability (-2)</strong>: Because I have mastered a potent magical discipline, when I am Carefully Arcane I can <strong>spend a Fate point</strong> to allow create an advantage to add the situational Aspect <strong>Globe Of Invulnerability</strong> with three (3) free invokes to myself for the remainder of the scene (and perhaps longer). I can add more invokes to this Aspect by being Carefully Arcane and creating an advantage against a difficulty of Great (+4). While this Aspect is available I can invoke it to use Carefully Arcane to defend against any kind of attack affecting me or the area immediately around me (including any allies). This Aspect can be overcome and removed by a character with Arcane, Divine, or Primal of +6 or higher opposed by a Wondrous (+10) difficulty.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +6 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Heed Me!</strong>: Because I have a magical knack that allows me to augment my spoken voice with enchanting magics I may use Arcane for social interactions if I can talk and my target can hear me. I am resisted by Arcane when I do so. This is a form of mind-affecting magic.</p>
<p>This stunt requires Arcane +1 or better to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Reflect Magic</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per scene if I am the target of a spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Quickly Focused; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Reflect Magic (-2)</strong>: Because I am able to reflect magic to protect myself, once per exchange if I am the target of a spell and I am aware of it I may overcome the same difficulty required to cast the spell while Quickly Focused; however I suffer a -2 penalty to my roll. If I am successful the spell has no effect on me and I turn the spell back upon its caster, against whom the spell has its full normal effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Retribution</strong>: Because my retribution is terrible when I succesfully attack an opponent who has inflicted stress or consequences upon me in the current conflict I inflict +1 shift more damage and this damage cannot be reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Reverberation</strong>: Because I know many Words of Power, if I am currently able to speak as a non-action I may spend a Fate point to utter a Word and immediately remove from play any one situational Aspect in my zone or an adjacent zone with a difficulty of Legendary (+8) or less to overcome. Though there is no 4dF roll involved, I am considered to be acting in a Flashily Arcane manner when I do this and the reverberations of the Word are very noticeable.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Secret Signs</strong>: Because I have an unusual mystical talent I sometimes see signs, portents, and sigils that provide me with information about the present or near future that I could not possibly know otherwise. I gain +2 while I am Focused and create advantage when I attempt to discover or notice some detail, fact, Aspect, or truth about the scene, or a person or group in it, even if it would not normally be possible for me to know or detect this information with merely mundane senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Slip Away (-2)</strong>: Because I am excellent at getting away with it and slipping away unseen, if there is a momentary distraction or opportunity I may spend a Fate point to immediately exit the scene by means appropriate to the narrative such as slippling away into a crowd, or through a hidden door to a secret escape hatch I happened to know about, or by using a magic item I happened to have, etc. I cannot be pursued in the current scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Sudden Slumber</strong>: Because I have mastered a magical talent from olden times, once per session I can put any number of nameless mooks who lack consequence slots in my zone or an adjacent zone to sleep. I may affect additional contiguous zones by spending a Fate point per additional zone. To do this I must use Carefully Arcane to create the advantage <strong>Sleep Now My Pretties</strong> against an Average (+1) difficulty. Those affected will sleep artificially deeply, and resist being woken for the remainder of the scene; someone trying to wake a victim must overcome a difficulty equal to Average (+1) plus my margin of success.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Superior Senses (-2)</strong>: Because I perceive the world via superior senses I can see perfectly in total darkness, even if I am 'blinded'. Additionally, I can sense invisibile things that are near me; I gain +2 while Focused to overcome any Aspect related to invisibility or a similar effect within my zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Universal Linguist</strong>: Because I have a special ability with languages, I can fluently speak and understand any spoken language I encounter.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Wild Shape (-2):</strong></p>
<p>Because I have the ability to change into the form of any normal animal of my choice, I may spend a Fate point to temporarily assume an animal form. My trappings magically change with me and are unavailable until I return to my normal form.</p>
<p>When I change forms I move all of my Approach bonuses to a disposition relevant to the animal form I am assuming, and I move all of my Archetype bonuses to Focused (leaving all of my other Archetypes at +0). This lasts for an entire scene unless I choose to return to normal, which ends the effect. Additionally, I may spend another Fate point to assume a different animal's form, and I do not have to first change back to normal.</p>
<p>When I change forms I gain an additional Aspect named for the animal form I have assumed which I can invoke when my current animal form is relevant, and which can be compelled whenever my animal form or lack of humanoid anatomy might inconvenience me.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has natural weapons I may use Focused in place of Combatives while in a physical conflict.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual form of movement, such as the flight of a bird, the running of a wolf, or the swimming of a shark then I gain that mode of movement while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>If the animal form I change into has an unusual or extra keen sense, such as the low light vision of a cat, the olfactory senses of a canine, or the echolocation of a bat then I gain that sense while I am in that form as well, at the GM's discretion.</p>
</div>
<p>This stunt requires Primal +1 or better to use. :::</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Willful Invisibility</strong>: Because I can turn invisibile at will, if I do not attack or create advantage in an exchange I may place the situational Aspect <strong>'Invisible'</strong> on myself as a free action that takes no time before or after my normal action. If I attack or create advantage while invisible, this Aspect is immediately removed and I become visibile for at least one (1) exchange before I am able to use this ability to become invisible again. My innate invisibility can be temporarily neutralized by those with unusual senses or magic or special items creating an applicable advantage; the difficulty to do so is Superb (+5). It can also be overcome and thus removed by some abilities that explicitly counter invisibility or dispel magic; the difficulty to do so is Fantastic (+6).</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Will To Power</strong>: Because my will to push forward to victory is absolute, once per session I may gain +4 when attempting to overcome any one (1) situational Aspect in my zone or an adjacent zone.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="undead-stunts">Undead Stunts</h2>
<p>Stunts related to being and Undead creature.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Healed By Draining Life Energies (-3)</strong>: Because I am strengthened by draining the life forces of others, whenever I successfully use Life Energy Drain to give a target a Consequence I may clear one of my own stress boxes or a Consequence with a numerical value equal to or less than the numerical value of the Consequnce I inflicted.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Life Energy Drain</strong>: Because I am able to drain the life energy from those I touch, if I inflict a Consequence on a target by hitting or touching them I afflict them with enervation and ennui. Consequences such as <strong>Easily Fatigued</strong>, <strong>Fits Of Ennui</strong>, <strong>Prone To Depression</strong>, and <strong>Sunk Into A Deep Funk</strong> cause those afflicted to struggle to motivate and empower themselves, to unexpectedly lose interest in being active, become unconcerned about succeeding in their endeavors, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Undead Resistances (-4)</strong>: Because I am Undead I am immune to death effects, disease, mental effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and energy drain. I also don't need to breathe and never get tired. However, postive energy inflicts 2 extra shifts of stress against me, and also I take stress from healing magics.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="warrior-stunts">Warrior Stunts</h2>
<p>Stunts related to martial feats, combatives, and being a superior combatant.</p>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Acrobatic Fighting</strong>: Because I am excellent at acrobatically flipping around and tumbling to good advantage while in combat, when I am engaged in a conflict I may add my Focused bonus to Combatives when I am able to make my acrobatics relevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Aggressive Assault</strong>: Because I am driven to extreme aggression, when I am Forcefully Combative and attack I may add from one to four additional Fate dice to my 4dF attack roll and choose the four best dice as my result. However, until my next exchange whenever I defend I add the same number of Fate dice to my defend rolls and choose the four worst dice as my result.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Barbarian Beatdown</strong>: Because I'm able to use my athleticism and physical advantages to good effect in a fight, I may use Focused instead of Combative when fighting with an appropriate weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Bums Rush</strong>: Because I like to overwhelm others, I get +2 when I am Forceful and attempt to tackle or bowl over an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Canny Guard</strong>: Because of my skill and experience as a warrior it is difficult to catch me off guard. When I am defending against physical attacks and tie, my opponent does not get a boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Charger</strong>: Because I excel at charging into combat to deliver a devastating attack, I gain +3 while Forcefully or Quickly Combative to make melee attacks in a conflict if I first move one or more zones in the same action to reach my opponent. I cannot split my shifts between multiple opponents when I do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Combative Aegis</strong>: Because I have developed my defensive form to a high degree of skill, when I am Carefully Combative and appropriately equipped, if someone else in my zone is physically attacked I may defend on their behalf. However I take any shifts of damage that get past my defenses, rather than the intended target.</p>

<p><strong>Medium Armor Training</strong>: Because I have trained to wear medium armor extensively, I gain +1 to Combatives to defend when I am appropriately armored.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Mounted Strike</strong>: Because I excel at ride-by attacks when mounted, whenever I am Quickly Combative and attack after moving a zone, if I succeed with style my mount and I may immediately move 1 zone away as a free action. If I also choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to move an additional zone further away. I may also choose to spend a Fate point to move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Passing Strike</strong>: Because I have a fast-moving agile fighting style, whenever I am Quickly Combative and attack, if I choose to reduce the damage I inflict to get a boost I may use that boost to immediately move one (1) zone away, as a free action. If I also spend a Fate point I may move an additional zone further away.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Pounce!</strong>: Because I excel at leaping into combat in a startling burst of aggression, I gain +4 on my first attack in a conflict if I act first and can charge, lunge at, or pounce upon an opponent.</p>

Additionally if I make a physical attack while armed appropriately and split shifts between exactly two opponents, I inflict +1 shift of additional damage to each target.</p>
</div>
<div class="description">
<p><strong>Warrior's Mettle</strong>: Because I have trained extensively and am made of sterner stuff than most people, I may use Combatives to defend against ranged attacks and targeted magic by deflecting such attacks with a precise flick or parry of my weapon, or with my armor or a shield, or by some other means justified by the narrative.</p>
<p>This Stunt requires Combative +2 to use.</p>
<p>NOTE: Combative +3 and higher already allows a character to do this. This Stunt is for characters who have Combative +2 and are willing to allocate a Stunt to gain this ability.</p>
</div>
